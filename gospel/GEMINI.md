# Directory Overview

This directory is a personal gospel study journal organized as an Obsidian vault. It contains the full text of the scriptures of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, along with personal notes and study materials. The structure is designed for easy cross-referencing and note-taking within the Obsidian application.

## Key Directories and Files

    *   `topics/`: Notes and thoughts on specific gospel topics.

## Usage

The primary use of this directory is for personal gospel study using the Obsidian application. The file and heading structure is specifically designed to leverage Obsidian's features for linking notes and ideas.

-   **Cross-referencing:** Verses can be linked directly using Wikilinks (e.g., `[[1nephi03#7]]`).
-   **Commenting:** Personal notes and comments can be added directly under verses using bullet points or blockquotes.
-   **Sequential Reading:** The numbered folders in the `scriptures` directory allow for sequential reading of the scriptures.
