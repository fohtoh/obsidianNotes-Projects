# Christ-Centered Analysis: Moses 3
## Come Follow Me Week 3 (January 12-18, 2026)
[[Genesis 1-2, Moses 2-3, Abraham 4-5 (Jan 12-18)]]

---

## Overview

Moses 3 provides a more detailed account of the creation of Adam and Eve, revealing profound truths about Jesus Christ's role as Creator, the establishment of divine patterns, and the purpose of mortal existence. While this chapter appears to focus on the physical creation, it is saturated with Christ-centered doctrine, symbolism, and typology. The Lord God (Jehovah, the pre-mortal Jesus Christ) is the active Creator throughout this chapter, establishing the Garden of Eden, forming man from the dust, creating woman, and instituting the sacred covenant of marriage. Every element of this creation account points us toward understanding Christ's mission to bring about the Father's plan of salvation.

## 1. Direct References to Jesus Christ

### "I, the Lord God" - Jehovah as Creator (Throughout the Chapter)

**"For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth."** (Moses 3:5)

**Analysis:**
The title "the Lord God" (or "LORD God" in KJV) translates the Hebrew "Jehovah Elohim." In Latter-day Saint theology, Jehovah is the pre-mortal Jesus Christ. This chapter uses "I, the Lord God" repeatedly (verses 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22), establishing beyond doubt that Jesus Christ was the Creator acting under the Father's direction.

**Key Declarations:**
- "I, the Lord God, made the heaven and the earth" (v. 4)
- "I, the Lord God, created all things...spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth" (v. 5)
- "I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground" (v. 7)
- "I, the Lord God, planted a garden eastward in Eden" (v. 8)
- "I, the Lord God, took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden" (v. 15)

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Every act of creation in Moses 3 is explicitly attributed to Jesus Christ (Jehovah). This establishes:
1. Christ's divine power and authority as Creator
2. His intimate involvement in preparing the earth for mankind
3. His role as the executor of the Father's plan
4. His personal relationship with Adam and Eve from the beginning

**Cross-References:**
- **John 1:1-3, 14**: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...All things were made by him...And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us"
- **D&C 76:24**: "That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God"
- **Colossians 1:16-17**: "For by him were all things created...all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist"
- **Mosiah 3:8**: "And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God...the Creator of all things from the beginning"

### The Only Begotten Consulted About Eve's Creation (Moses 3:18)

**"And I, the Lord God, said unto mine Only Begotten, that it was not good that the man should be alone; wherefore, I will make an help meet for him."**

**Analysis:**
This verse provides a sacred glimpse into the council between God the Father and Jesus Christ (the Only Begotten) regarding the creation of woman. This reveals:
- The Father and Son work in perfect unity
- Christ was involved in planning and executing every aspect of creation
- The creation of woman was a divine decision made in council
- Even the specific details of mortal existence were planned by Deity

**Doctrinal Significance:**
This verse shows that the Father consulted with Christ before creating Eve, demonstrating:
1. The partnership between Father and Son in all creation
2. The sacred importance of marriage and family in God's plan
3. That human relationships were divinely designed, not evolutionary accidents
4. The premortal Christ's role in establishing the pattern of eternal families

**Cross-References:**
- **Abraham 4:26-27**: "And the Gods took counsel among themselves and said: Let us go down and form man in our image...So the Gods went down to organize man in their own image"
- **Genesis 1:26**: "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness"
- **Moses 2:26-27**: Similar council language about creating mankind
- **D&C 76:23-24**: "For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father"

**Teaching Application:**
When we understand that God the Father specifically consulted with Jesus Christ before creating Eve, we see that marriage between man and woman is not merely a social arrangement but a sacred institution designed by Deity. The Savior Himself participated in establishing this eternal pattern.

### The Seventh Day Rest - Foreshadowing the Sabbath and Christ's Completed Work (Moses 3:2-3)

**"And on the seventh day I, God, ended my work, and all things which I had made; and I rested on the seventh day from all my work...And I, God, blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it I had rested from all my work which I, God, had created and made."**

**Analysis:**
God's rest on the seventh day establishes both the Sabbath pattern and foreshadows Christ's completed atoning work:
- God completed His creative work and rested
- He blessed and sanctified the seventh day
- This establishes the pattern for the Sabbath commandment

**Connection to Christ:**
The seventh-day rest points forward to Christ's completed Atonement:
- Just as God finished His creative work, Christ finished His redeeming work
- Christ's last words on the cross: "It is finished" (John 19:30)
- The Sabbath becomes a day to remember Christ's completed Atonement
- Our spiritual rest comes through Christ's finished work

**Cross-References:**
- **Hebrews 4:3-4, 9-10**: "For we which have believed do enter into rest...For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day...There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his"
- **D&C 59:9-10**: "And that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day"
- **Exodus 20:8-11**: The Sabbath commandment referencing God's creation rest

**Doctrinal Significance:**
The Sabbath is not arbitrary but rooted in the creation narrative. When we observe the Sabbath, we:
1. Commemorate Christ's creative work
2. Remember His completed atoning sacrifice
3. Enter into spiritual rest from our labors
4. Look forward to our eternal rest with Him

## 2. Symbolic and Typological References to Christ

### Spiritual Creation Before Physical Creation (Moses 3:5, 7)

**"For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth...for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth."**

**Analysis:**
This doctrine of dual creation (spiritual first, then physical) has profound Christ-centered implications:

**Spiritual Creation:**
- All things existed spiritually before being physically created
- This includes all mankind—we are spirit children of God
- We lived in God's presence before mortality
- A plan of salvation was prepared before the world was created

**Connection to Christ:**
This doctrine testifies of Christ's premortal role:
- Christ was chosen as Savior in the premortal world (1 Peter 1:19-20)
- The Atonement was planned before the physical creation
- We knew and sustained Christ as our Savior before coming to earth
- The physical creation served the spiritual purpose of implementing the plan of salvation

**Cross-References:**
- **Abraham 3:22-27**: The premortal council where Christ was chosen
- **Jeremiah 1:5**: "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee"
- **Job 38:4-7**: "Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth...when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"
- **Alma 13:3**: "They were called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Understanding that we existed spiritually before mortality helps us recognize:
1. Our premortal relationship with Christ
2. That we chose to come to earth knowing we would need a Savior
3. That Christ's mission was not an afterthought but the central plan from the beginning
4. Our mortal bodies are a step in eternal progression made possible by Christ

**Teaching Application:**
Help family members understand that before God created our physical bodies, He created us as His spirit children. The entire physical creation was designed to facilitate the Father's plan, which centers on Jesus Christ redeeming us and bringing us back to God's presence.

### The Breath of Life - Christ as the Source of All Life (Moses 3:7, 19)

**"And I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."**

**Analysis:**
Christ (Jehovah) personally breathed life into Adam, making him a living soul:
- Man's body came from the earth (dust)
- Man's life came from God (breath)
- The combination created a "living soul"

**Symbolic Connection to Christ:**
This act of breathing life symbolizes Christ as the source of all life:
- Physical life: Christ gives us mortal life through birth
- Spiritual life: Christ gives us spiritual life through His Atonement
- Eternal life: Christ offers immortality through resurrection and exaltation through grace

**The Pattern Repeated:**
- Christ breathed life into Adam physically
- Christ breathes spiritual life into us through the Holy Ghost
- After His resurrection, Christ breathed on His disciples and said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost" (John 20:22)

**Cross-References:**
- **John 1:4**: "In him was life; and the life was the light of men"
- **John 5:26**: "For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself"
- **John 11:25**: "I am the resurrection, and the life"
- **Mosiah 2:21**: "He is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath"
- **John 20:22**: "He breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Every breath we take is a gift from Christ, who breathed life into Adam. We are utterly dependent on Christ for:
1. Our mortal existence (He sustains us breath by breath)
2. Our spiritual rebirth (we must be "born again" through His Spirit)
3. Our eternal life (resurrection and exaltation come only through Him)

**Teaching Application:**
As we breathe, we can remember that Jesus Christ is the source of our life. Just as He breathed life into Adam, He breathes spiritual life into us through the Holy Ghost. Without Him, we are merely dust.

### The Tree of Life - Symbol of Jesus Christ (Moses 3:9)

**"And I, the Lord God, planted the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and also the tree of knowledge of good and evil."**

**Analysis:**
The Tree of Life is one of scripture's most powerful symbols of Jesus Christ:
- Located in the "midst" (center) of the garden
- Represents eternal life and God's love
- Eating its fruit brings immortality and eternal life
- Christ is "the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6)

**Cross-References:**
- **1 Nephi 11:21-22**: "And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father! Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw? And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God"
- **1 Nephi 15:36**: "The tree of life is...the love of God; and whoso partaketh of his love he shall partake of his fruit; and whoso partaketh of his fruit...shall have eternal life"
- **Revelation 2:7**: "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God"
- **Alma 32:40-42**: Faith and the word are compared to a tree that brings forth fruit unto eternal life

**Doctrinal Significance:**
The Tree of Life represents:
1. Jesus Christ Himself
2. The love of God manifest through Christ's Atonement
3. Eternal life available only through Christ
4. The central focus of God's plan (placed in the "midst" of the garden)

**Symbolic Layers:**
- **Position**: In the "midst" = Christ is central to God's plan
- **Nature**: A tree = Christ was "hung on a tree" (Acts 5:30, 1 Peter 2:24)
- **Fruit**: Brings eternal life = Christ's Atonement brings eternal life
- **Access**: Must be sought and partaken = We must actively come unto Christ

**Teaching Application:**
In Lehi's vision (1 Nephi 8), the Tree of Life is the destination of the righteous. Nephi learns that the tree represents God's love manifest in Jesus Christ (1 Nephi 11:21-22). From the very beginning in Eden, Christ was symbolized by the Tree of Life in the midst of the garden. He has always been central to God's plan.

### The Garden of Eden - Paradise Restored Through Christ (Moses 3:8, 15)

**"And I, the Lord God, planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there I put the man whom I had formed...And I, the Lord God, took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it."**

**Analysis:**
The Garden of Eden represents:
- The original paradise where man dwelt with God
- A state of innocence and communion with Deity
- The ideal condition before the Fall

**Connection to Christ:**
Christ is the way back to paradise:
- Eden was paradise lost through the Fall
- Christ makes paradise regained possible through the Atonement
- Christ promised the thief on the cross: "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise" (Luke 23:43)
- Through Christ, we return to God's presence (spiritual Eden)

**Cross-References:**
- **Luke 23:43**: "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise"
- **2 Nephi 2:19-25**: The Fall was part of God's plan, made redemptive through Christ
- **Alma 42:2-3**: Cherubim and flaming sword guarded the tree of life lest man partake and live forever in sin; Christ removes this barrier through the Atonement
- **Revelation 2:7**: "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
The Garden represents:
1. Man's original state with God
2. What was lost through the Fall
3. What Christ restores through the Atonement
4. Our ultimate celestial destination

**Teaching Application:**
Just as the Lord God (Christ) personally placed Adam in the Garden, Christ personally brings us back into God's presence. The paradise lost in Eden is restored through Christ's Atonement, ultimately fulfilled in the celestial kingdom.

### Rivers and Living Water - Christ as the Source (Moses 3:10)

**"And I, the Lord God, caused a river to go out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads."**

**Analysis:**
The river flowing from Eden to water the garden symbolizes Christ as the source of living water:
- Water brings life to the garden
- Water flows from the center (where the Tree of Life is)
- Water spreads in all directions (four heads)
- Without water, the garden would die

**Symbolic Connection to Christ:**
Throughout scripture, Christ is represented as living water:
- He is the source of spiritual life
- His grace flows to all people in all directions
- Without Him, we spiritually die
- Partaking of His "water" brings eternal life

**Cross-References:**
- **John 4:10, 14**: "Jesus answered...If thou knewest the gift of God...whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life"
- **John 7:37-38**: "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink...out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water"
- **Revelation 22:1-2**: "And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life"
- **1 Nephi 11:25**: "The rod of iron...is the word of God...which leadeth to the fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of the love of God"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
The river in Eden foreshadows Christ as the source of living water that:
1. Brings spiritual life to all who partake
2. Flows from God's throne (the center of paradise)
3. Spreads in all directions to bless all nations
4. Must be continually accessed to sustain life

### The Creation of Woman from Adam's Rib - Christ and His Church (Moses 3:21-24)

**"And I, the Lord God, caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam; and he slept, and I took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in the stead thereof; And the rib which I, the Lord God, had taken from man, made I a woman, and brought her unto the man."**

**Analysis:**
This beautiful account has profound typological significance pointing to Christ and His Church:

**Adam as a Type of Christ:**
- Adam fell into deep sleep → Christ died (deep sleep of death)
- His side was opened → Christ's side was pierced (John 19:34)
- From his side came Eve → From Christ's sacrifice came the Church
- Eve became his bride → The Church is the Bride of Christ

**Eve as a Type of the Church:**
- Created from Adam → The Church comes from Christ's sacrifice
- Brought to Adam → Christ will receive His bride (the Church)
- Became "one flesh" with Adam → We become one with Christ

**Cross-References:**
- **Ephesians 5:25-32**: "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it...For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church"
- **John 19:34**: "But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water"
- **Revelation 19:7-9**: "The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready...Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb"
- **2 Corinthians 11:2**: "For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
This creation account is not merely historical but prophetic and symbolic:
1. Adam represents Christ in His sacrificial role
2. Eve represents the Church (covenant people) who come forth from Christ's sacrifice
3. Marriage represents the eternal covenant between Christ and His faithful followers
4. "One flesh" represents our unity with Christ through covenant

**Teaching Application:**
Paul explicitly teaches that the creation of Eve from Adam's side is a "great mystery" concerning Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5:32). When we understand this symbolism, the creation account becomes a beautiful testimony of Christ's love for His covenant people and His desire to be eternally united with us.

### Man's Dominion Over Creation - Christ's Ultimate Dominion (Moses 3:19-20)

**"And out of the ground I, the Lord God, formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and commanded that they should come unto Adam, to see what he would call them...And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field."**

**Analysis:**
Adam's authority to name the animals represents delegated divine authority:
- Naming something signifies authority over it
- Adam exercised dominion under God's direction
- This foreshadows Christ's complete dominion

**Connection to Christ:**
Adam's limited dominion points to Christ's complete dominion:
- Adam had authority over earthly creation
- Christ has "all power in heaven and in earth" (Matthew 28:18)
- All things are subject to Christ (Ephesians 1:22)
- Christ will ultimately "subdue all things unto himself" (Philippians 3:21)

**Cross-References:**
- **Philippians 2:9-11**: "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow...And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord"
- **Hebrews 2:8**: "Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet"
- **D&C 76:106-107**: Christ "is Lord of all...to him shall all knees bow and all tongues confess"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Adam's authority to name creation was delegated from Christ, the Creator. This establishes the pattern that all righteous authority comes from Christ and must be exercised according to His will.

### The Commandment and Agency - Christ Makes Choice Meaningful (Moses 3:16-17)

**"And I, the Lord God, commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."**

**Analysis:**
This commandment establishes the principle of agency with profound Christ-centered implications:
- God gives a commandment ("thou shalt not eat")
- God grants agency ("nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself")
- God warns of consequences ("thou shalt surely die")

**Connection to Christ:**
This pattern reveals why Christ's Atonement was necessary:
1. Law must exist for there to be sin or righteousness
2. Agency makes choice meaningful
3. Choice brings consequences (including spiritual death)
4. Christ's Atonement provides redemption from the consequences of wrong choices
5. Without opposition and choice, there would be no need for a Savior

**Cross-References:**
- **2 Nephi 2:11, 15-16**: "For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things...And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man...the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other"
- **2 Nephi 2:27**: "Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh...And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death"
- **Helaman 14:30-31**: "And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
The commandment with agency creates the conditions for:
1. Moral growth and development
2. The need for Christ's redemptive power
3. Meaningful choice between good and evil
4. The exercise of faith in Christ
5. Repentance and forgiveness through Christ

**Teaching Application:**
God could have prevented Adam and Eve from eating the forbidden fruit, but instead He gave them agency to choose. This pattern continues today—God gives us commandments, grants us agency, warns us of consequences, and provides a Savior to redeem us when we fall short. Without agency, there would be no need for Christ's Atonement. Agency and the Atonement are inseparably connected.

## 3. Doctrinal Connections to Christ's Role

### Christ as Creator of Man in God's Image

**Foundational Truth:**
Moses 3:7 states that Christ (the Lord God) "formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."

**Christ-Centered Doctrine:**
This teaches that:
1. Christ personally formed our physical bodies
2. We are created in God's image (Moses 2:26-27)
3. Our physical bodies are sacred, created by divine hands
4. The body and spirit together constitute the soul (D&C 88:15)

**Connection to Christ's Mission:**
- Christ created us → He knows us perfectly
- He formed our bodies → He values the body and provided resurrection
- We are in His image → We have divine potential through Him
- He gave us breath → We depend on Him for life moment by moment

**Cross-References:**
- **D&C 76:24**: "That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God"
- **1 Corinthians 15:47-49**: "The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven...And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly"

### The Pattern of Marriage - Eternal Families Through Christ

**Foundational Truth:**
Moses 3:24 declares: "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh."

**Christ-Centered Doctrine:**
This first marriage, performed by Christ Himself, establishes the eternal pattern:
1. Marriage is divinely instituted by Christ
2. Husband and wife become "one flesh" (unity in Christ)
3. This ordinance predates the Fall and is part of the original plan
4. Eternal families are central to God's plan

**Connection to Christ's Mission:**
- Christ instituted marriage → It is a sacred ordinance
- He brought Eve to Adam → He brings covenant companions together
- "One flesh" → Sealed by Christ's authority for eternity
- The first marriage was performed before death entered the world → Marriages can be eternal

**Cross-References:**
- **D&C 132:19-20**: "If a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant...it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity"
- **Matthew 19:4-6**: Jesus quoted this very passage when teaching about marriage: "Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female...What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder"
- **1 Corinthians 11:11**: "Neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord"

**Teaching Application:**
When Christ brought Eve to Adam and pronounced them husband and wife, He established the pattern for eternal marriage. This was not a temporary arrangement for mortality only, but the divine pattern. Through Christ's sealing power, marriages can endure beyond death, fulfilling the original design from Eden.

### The Purpose of Mortality - Made Possible by Christ

**Foundational Truth:**
Moses 3:5 reveals: "For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth...for in heaven created I them."

**Christ-Centered Doctrine:**
The dual creation (spiritual then physical) reveals God's plan:
1. We existed as spirits before mortal birth
2. Physical creation serves spiritual purposes
3. Earth life is part of eternal progression
4. All of this requires Christ's redeeming power

**Connection to Christ's Mission:**
The physical creation was necessary for the plan of salvation:
- We needed physical bodies → Christ makes resurrection possible
- We would face sin and death → Christ provides the Atonement
- We needed agency and opposition → Christ provides redemption from wrong choices
- We needed to be tested → Christ provides strength to endure

**Cross-References:**
- **Abraham 3:24-25**: "And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down...and we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them"
- **2 Nephi 2:22-25**: "If Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen...And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed...they would have had no children...Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Everything Christ created in Moses 3 serves the Father's plan to bring about our immortality and eternal life. The physical creation was not an end in itself but the means to accomplish eternal purposes—all made possible through Christ.

### The Sabbath Rest - Finding Rest in Christ

**Foundational Truth:**
Moses 3:2-3 teaches that God "rested on the seventh day" and "blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it."

**Christ-Centered Doctrine:**
The Sabbath points to the rest available in Christ:
1. Physical rest from labor
2. Spiritual rest from sin through repentance
3. Eternal rest in God's presence

**Connection to Christ's Mission:**
- God rested after completing creation → Christ rested after completing the Atonement
- The seventh day was blessed → The Sabbath helps us remember Christ's blessings
- We rest from our labors → We cease from our own efforts to save ourselves
- We enter God's rest → Only through Christ can we enter eternal rest

**Cross-References:**
- **Matthew 11:28-30**: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you...For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light"
- **Hebrews 4:3, 9-10**: "For we which have believed do enter into rest...There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his"
- **Moroni 7:3**: "Behold, I am come to judge the world; and to bring salvation unto all those who shall believe on his name"

**Teaching Application:**
The Sabbath is not just a day off from work—it's a sacred symbol of the rest we find in Christ. Just as God completed His creative work and rested, Christ completed His atoning work and invites us to rest in Him, ceasing from our own efforts to earn salvation and accepting His grace.

## 4. How Moses 3 Testifies of Jesus Christ and His Mission

### Christ as the Personal God

Moses 3 reveals Christ's personal involvement in creation:
- He personally formed Adam from the dust
- He personally breathed life into Adam
- He personally planted the Garden
- He personally brought Eve to Adam
- He personally gave commandments to Adam and Eve

**Testimony:**
Jesus Christ is not a distant, impersonal force. He is intimately involved in every detail of our existence. The same hands that formed Adam from dust were the hands that were nailed to the cross for our redemption. The Creator became the Redeemer.

### Christ as the Establisher of Divine Patterns

Moses 3 shows Christ establishing patterns that endure:
- The Sabbath day of rest
- Marriage between man and woman
- Human stewardship over creation
- Agency and commandment-keeping
- Life in God's presence (Eden)

**Testimony:**
These patterns were not cultural inventions but divine designs established by Christ from the beginning. They remain binding and beautiful today because they come from Him.

### Christ as the Source of All Life

Every form of life in Moses 3 comes from Christ:
- "I, the Lord God, created all things" (v. 5)
- "I, God, breathed into them the breath of life" (v. 19)
- The Tree of Life symbolizes Christ (v. 9)
- Rivers of living water flow from Eden (v. 10)

**Testimony:**
All life—physical, spiritual, and eternal—comes from Jesus Christ. He is "the resurrection and the life" (John 11:25). Without Him, we have no life.

### Christ as the Lawgiver

Christ gave the first commandment to mankind:
- Instructions about eating from the trees
- Warning about consequences
- Grant of agency to choose
- Clear communication of God's will

**Testimony:**
Christ's commandments are not arbitrary restrictions but loving guidance from our Creator who knows what will bring us true happiness. He commands because He loves, and He provides a way (through His Atonement) for us to return when we fall short.

### Christ Preparing for the Fall and Redemption

Everything in Moses 3 anticipates what would come:
- The Tree of Knowledge prepared the way for the Fall
- The Tree of Life represented the redemption
- Agency made choice possible
- Consequences made the Atonement necessary
- The physical creation made mortality possible

**Testimony:**
Even in the perfect Garden of Eden, Christ was preparing for the Fall and the subsequent redemption. The entire creation was designed with the Atonement in mind. Christ didn't create a perfect world that accidentally went wrong—He created the perfect conditions for the plan of salvation to unfold, with Himself as the central Redeemer.

## 5. Key Themes That Point to Christ

### Theme 1: The Dual Nature of Creation (Spiritual Before Physical)

**Verses:** 5, 7

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
The pattern of spiritual creation before physical creation testifies that:
- We lived with God before mortal birth
- We have a divine origin and destiny
- The physical creation serves eternal spiritual purposes
- Christ's Atonement was planned before the physical world was created

**Application:**
Understanding our premortal existence helps us see that we are not cosmic accidents but beloved spirit children of God, sent to earth with a divine purpose. Christ was chosen as our Savior before the world was created, demonstrating the centrality of His mission to our eternal existence.

**Teaching Moment:**
Ask family members: "Why do you think God created all things spiritually before creating them physically?" Help them see that the spiritual is primary and eternal, while the physical is temporary and serves the spiritual. This elevates our perspective from merely physical/temporal to spiritual/eternal.

### Theme 2: The Breath of Life from Christ

**Verses:** 7, 19

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
Christ personally breathing life into Adam teaches:
- Our complete dependence on Christ for existence
- The intimate, personal nature of our relationship with Christ
- The sacredness of life as a gift from God
- The pattern of spiritual rebirth ("born again" through Christ's Spirit)

**Application:**
Every breath we take is a reminder that Jesus Christ sustains our life. Just as He breathed physical life into Adam, He offers to breathe spiritual life into us through the Holy Ghost. The resurrected Christ breathed on His disciples and said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost" (John 20:22), connecting this creation symbol to our spiritual rebirth.

**Cross-Reference Activity:**
Compare Moses 3:7 (Christ breathing life into Adam) with John 20:22 (Christ breathing the Holy Ghost on His disciples). The same divine breath that gave us physical life offers us spiritual life.

### Theme 3: The Tree of Life in the Midst

**Verse:** 9

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
The Tree of Life positioned "in the midst of the garden" symbolizes:
- Christ at the center of God's plan
- The centrality of eternal life through Christ
- God's love manifest through Christ (1 Nephi 11:21-22)
- The ultimate goal of our existence—to partake of Christ and gain eternal life

**Application:**
Just as the Tree of Life was at the center of Eden, Jesus Christ should be at the center of our lives. Everything else in the garden (and our lives) radiates from this center. When we put Christ in the midst of our lives, everything else finds its proper place.

**Visualization Activity:**
Draw a simple map of Eden with the Tree of Life in the center. Discuss how everything in the garden related to this central tree. Compare this to our lives—when Christ is at our center, everything else aligns properly.

### Theme 4: The Marriage Covenant

**Verses:** 18, 21-24

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
The first marriage, performed by Christ, establishes:
- Marriage as a divine ordinance, not a human invention
- The eternal nature of the marriage covenant
- The symbolism of Christ (Bridegroom) and the Church (Bride)
- The sacred nature of the union between man and woman

**Application:**
Because Jesus Christ Himself instituted marriage in Eden, it is holy and eternal. When we see our own marriages (or the marriages of parents/others) struggling, we can remember that Christ designed marriage to be a source of joy and growth, patterned after His love for the Church.

**Doctrinal Connection:**
Paul explicitly connects the creation of Eve from Adam's side to "Christ and the church" (Ephesians 5:32). This is not just symbolism imposed on the text—it's the intended meaning from the beginning.

**Teaching Moment:**
Read Moses 3:21-24 and Ephesians 5:25-32 together. Help family members see that the creation account is both literal history and prophetic symbol pointing to Christ's relationship with His covenant people.

### Theme 5: Agency and Commandment

**Verses:** 16-17

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
The paradoxical commandment ("thou shalt not eat...nevertheless, thou mayest choose") establishes:
- The necessity of agency for spiritual growth
- The reality of consequences for choices
- The need for a Savior when we choose wrongly
- God's respect for our freedom even at great cost

**Application:**
God could have prevented the Fall by not giving agency, but then there would be no growth, no progression, no need for Christ's Atonement. Agency and the Atonement are eternally linked—we cannot have one without the other.

**Doctrinal Insight:**
Lehi teaches that without opposition and agency, we would be "dead things" with "no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility" (2 Nephi 2:11). The gift of agency necessitated the gift of Christ's Atonement.

**Teaching Moment:**
Discuss this verse carefully: "Thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it." This is not a contradiction—it's the foundation of moral agency. God commands, but allows us to choose, knowing that when we choose wrongly, Christ stands ready to redeem.

### Theme 6: The Sabbath Rest

**Verses:** 2-3

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
God's rest on the seventh day teaches:
- The completion of God's creative work
- The pattern for our weekly worship
- The spiritual rest available in Christ
- The eternal rest we seek in God's presence

**Application:**
When we observe the Sabbath, we remember:
1. Christ finished His creative work (Moses 3:2)
2. Christ finished His atoning work ("It is finished," John 19:30)
3. Christ invites us to find rest in Him (Matthew 11:28-30)
4. Christ promises eternal rest to the faithful (Hebrews 4:9-10)

**Cross-Reference:**
Hebrews 4 connects God's creation rest, Israel's promised land rest, and the ultimate spiritual rest in Christ. All three meanings layer upon each other in Moses 3:2-3.

### Theme 7: "It Was Not Good That Man Should Be Alone"

**Verse:** 18

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
God's declaration that "it was not good that the man should be alone" teaches:
- We are created for relationships, not isolation
- The family is central to God's plan
- We need each other to progress
- Christ Himself participates in relationship (Father and Son in council)

**Application:**
Just as Adam needed Eve to fulfill God's plan for him, we need covenant relationships (marriage, family, church community) to progress toward eternal life. Christ's plan is inherently relational—we are saved together, not in isolation.

**Connection to Christ's Mission:**
Christ's work is to bring us into relationship:
- With God the Father
- With our eternal families
- With the community of Saints
- With Him personally

The declaration "it was not good that the man should be alone" reveals God's heart—He desires relationship with us, and designed us to desire relationship with others. This is why Christ's Atonement not only reconciles us to God but also to each other.

## 7. Testimony-Building Insights

### Christ Knows Us Because He Created Us

Moses 3 shows Christ's intimate involvement in creating Adam:
- He personally formed Adam's body from dust
- He personally breathed life into Adam
- He personally placed Adam in the garden
- He personally brought Eve to Adam

**Testimony:**
Because Jesus Christ personally created us, He knows us perfectly—every thought, every feeling, every struggle, every hope. He is not a distant God but our Creator who knows us better than we know ourselves. This knowledge makes His Atonement perfectly tailored to each individual need.

**Cross-Reference:**
- Isaiah 64:8: "But now, O Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand"
- Psalm 139:13-16: "For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb...Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written"

### The Creator Became the Redeemer

**Theological Paradox:**
The same hands that formed Adam from dust were the hands pierced with nails for our redemption. The Creator became the atoning sacrifice.

**Testimony:**
This is the beauty of the gospel—Christ did not create us and then abandon us to our fate. He created us, knowing we would need a Savior, and He Himself became that Savior. His creative work and redemptive work are one continuous act of love.

**Cross-Reference:**
- Mosiah 15:1: "And thus God breaketh the bands of death, having gained the victory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for the children of men"
- Mosiah 3:8: "And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning"

### Everything Created with the Atonement in Mind

**Profound Truth:**
Moses 3 shows that even in the perfect Garden of Eden, before the Fall, Christ was preparing for the Atonement:
- The Tree of Knowledge made choice possible
- The Tree of Life represented eternal life through Christ
- Agency and commandment created the need for redemption
- Physical creation made mortality and resurrection necessary

**Testimony:**
The Fall was not an accident that derailed God's plan—it was part of the plan from the beginning. Christ created a world where agency, opposition, and choice would lead to the need for His atoning sacrifice. He didn't create a perfect world that went wrong; He created the perfect conditions for us to learn, grow, and ultimately become like Him through His grace.

**Cross-Reference:**
- 1 Peter 1:19-20: "But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world"
- Revelation 13:8: "The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world"

### Patterns of Eternity Established

**Enduring Truths:**
Moses 3 shows Christ establishing patterns that endure forever:
- The Sabbath (v. 2-3)
- Marriage between man and woman (v. 18, 22-24)
- Human stewardship (v. 15)
- Agency and moral law (v. 16-17)
- Life in God's presence (the Garden)

**Testimony:**
These are not temporary, cultural arrangements but eternal patterns established by Christ from the foundation of the world. When we live according to these patterns, we align ourselves with Christ and His eternal purposes.

### Christ's Personal Nature

**Beautiful Reality:**
Throughout Moses 3, we see Christ personally involved:
- "I, the Lord God, formed man" (v. 7)
- "I, the Lord God, planted a garden" (v. 8)
- "I, the Lord God, took the man, and put him into the Garden" (v. 15)
- "I, the Lord God, said unto mine Only Begotten" (v. 18)
- "I, the Lord God, caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam" (v. 21)
- "I, the Lord God...made I a woman, and brought her unto the man" (v. 22)

**Testimony:**
Jesus Christ is not an impersonal force or distant deity. He is personally, intimately involved in every detail of our lives. The same Christ who personally formed Adam, personally calls us by name today. He is our Creator, our Redeemer, and our Friend.

**Cross-Reference:**
- Moses 1:6: "Thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten"
- D&C 18:10-11: "Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God; For, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh"
- John 10:3: "He calleth his own sheep by name"

## 8. Conclusion: The Christ-Centered Message of Moses 3

Moses 3 reveals Jesus Christ as the Creator who formed man with His own hands, breathed life into him, prepared a garden paradise for him, instituted marriage, and established the sacred patterns that would govern mortal and eternal life. Every verse points to Christ's divine nature, His intimate involvement in our existence, and His preparation for our redemption.

### Central Truths About Jesus Christ from Moses 3:

1. **Christ as Creator:** "I, the Lord God" appears repeatedly, establishing that Jesus Christ (Jehovah) personally created all things, especially mankind

2. **Christ as the Source of Life:** He breathed the breath of life into Adam, making him a living soul—we depend on Christ for both physical and spiritual life

3. **Christ as the Tree of Life:** Positioned in the midst of the garden, representing God's love and eternal life available through Christ

4. **Christ as the Institutor of Sacred Ordinances:** He performed the first marriage, blessed the Sabbath, and established patterns for eternal families

5. **Christ in Council with the Father:** The Father consulted with the Only Begotten about creating Eve, showing Their perfect unity and Christ's central role

6. **Christ Preparing for Redemption:** Even in Eden's perfection, Christ was establishing the conditions (agency, commandment, choice) that would require His atoning sacrifice

7. **Christ as the Personal God:** His hands-on involvement in creating Adam, planting the garden, and bringing Eve to Adam shows His intimate, personal nature

### The Divine Pattern:

Creation → Fall → Redemption

Moses 3 shows the "Creation" phase, but it already anticipates what would follow:
- The Tree of Knowledge prepared for the Fall
- The Tree of Life represented the Redemption
- Agency made choice possible
- Consequences made the Atonement necessary
- All creation served the Father's plan centered in Christ

### Final Testimony:

Moses 3 testifies that Jesus Christ is the Creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life, the establisher of eternal patterns, and the personal God who knows and loves each of us individually. He did not create us and then leave us alone—He created us with full knowledge of what we would need, and He Himself became our Savior.

Every breath we take reminds us of the breath Christ breathed into Adam. Every tree, plant, and living thing testifies that Christ is the Creator. Every marriage reflects the union Christ performed in Eden. Every Sabbath day calls us to rest in Christ. Every moment of agency and choice reminds us of our need for the Redeemer.

I testify that Jesus Christ is the Creator and Redeemer, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. He who formed man from dust humbled Himself to become mortal, to bleed from every pore, and to die on a cross—all to redeem that which He created. The Creator became the atoning sacrifice. This is the message of Moses 3, and it is the foundation of all our hope.

As we study this sacred chapter, may our eyes be opened to see Christ on every page, in every verse, in every creative act. May we recognize His hand in our own creation and in the creation of all good things around us. And may we come unto Him, the Tree of Life, and partake of His love, His grace, and His eternal life.

In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, our Creator and Redeemer, amen.
