## Come Follow Me Week 2 (January 5-11, 2026)
[[Moses 1, Abraham 3 (Jan 5-11)]]

---

## Overview

Moses 1 records Moses's encounter with God on Mount Sinai before he received the Law. This chapter is rich with testimony of [[Jesus Christ]], revealing His divine role as the Only Begotten Son of the Father, the Creator, and the Savior. While Moses converses with God the Father, the chapter contains powerful direct references to Christ and profound symbolic teachings about His mission.

---

## 1. Direct References to Jesus Christ

### The Only Begotten Son - The Savior (Moses 1:6)

**"And, behold, thou art my son; wherefore look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands; but not all, for my works are without end, and also my words, for they never cease. Wherefore, no man can behold all my works, except he behold all my glory; and no man can behold all my glory, and afterwards remain in the flesh on the earth. And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior, for he is full of grace and truth; but there is no God beside me, and all things are present with me, for I know them all."** (Moses 1:4-6)

**Analysis:**
This is one of the most direct and beautiful testimonies of Christ in all scripture. The Father declares:
- **"Mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior"** - A clear declaration of Christ's identity and mission
- **"He is full of grace and truth"** - Echoes John 1:14, "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth"
- The use of "is and shall be" shows Christ's eternal nature and His foreordained role

**Doctrinal Significance:**
This teaches that Christ's role as Savior was established before His mortal birth. The phrase "full of grace and truth" testifies that salvation comes only through Christ's grace (unmerited divine assistance) combined with eternal truth.

### Christ the Creator (Moses 1:32-33)

**"And by the word of my power, have I created them, which is mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth. And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten."**

**Analysis:**
This passage reveals Christ's divine role as Creator under the Father's direction:
- "By the word of my power" = Christ is the "Word" (John 1:1-3, 14)
- Christ created "worlds without number"
- Creation was accomplished "by the Son"

**Cross-References:**
- **John 1:1-3**: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made."
- **Colossians 1:16**: "For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible...all things were created by him, and for him"
- **Hebrews 1:2**: "Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son...by whom also he made the worlds"
- **D&C 76:24**: "That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Christ is not merely a spiritual teacher but the divine Creator of all things. This establishes His power, authority, and divine nature. Everything we see testifies of Christ because He made it all.

### Calling Upon God in the Name of the Only Begotten (Moses 1:17)

**"And he also gave me commandments when he called unto me out of the burning bush, saying: Call upon God in the name of mine Only Begotten, and worship me."**

**Analysis:**
This reveals the sacred pattern of prayer and worship established before Christ's mortal ministry:
- Prayer must be offered in Christ's name
- Worship is directed to the Father, but access comes through the Son
- This pattern was revealed anciently, not just after Christ's resurrection

**Cross-References:**
- **2 Nephi 32:9**: "Ye must always pray unto the Father in my name"
- **3 Nephi 18:19**: "Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name"
- **John 14:6**: "No man cometh unto the Father, but by me"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
This teaches that Jesus Christ has always been the mediator between God and man. There is no access to the Father except through the Son. This was true in Moses's day and remains true today.

### Moses Commands Satan to Depart in Christ's Name (Moses 1:21)

**"And now Satan began to tremble, and the earth shook; and Moses received strength, and called upon God, saying: In the name of the Only Begotten, depart hence, Satan."**

**Analysis:**
Moses exercises the power of Christ's name to cast out Satan:
- The name of Christ has power over evil
- Satan trembles at the invocation of Christ's name
- Spiritual strength comes through calling upon Christ

**Cross-References:**
- **Philippians 2:10**: "That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow"
- **D&C 50:13-14**: "Wherefore, I the Lord ask you this question—unto what were ye ordained? To preach my gospel by the Spirit...to be sent to preach my gospel by the Spirit of truth"

### The Holy Ghost Bears Record of the Father and the Son (Moses 1:24)

**"And it came to pass that when Satan had departed from the presence of Moses, that Moses lifted up his eyes unto heaven, being filled with the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of the Father and the Son."**

**Analysis:**
This verse teaches the distinct roles of the Godhead:
- The Holy Ghost's mission is to testify of the Father and the Son
- The Spirit filled Moses and gave him power to resist evil
- The three members of the Godhead work in perfect unity

**Cross-References:**
- **2 Nephi 31:18**: "And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and the Son"
- **John 15:26**: "But when the Comforter is come...he shall testify of me"
- **3 Nephi 11:32**: "And this is my doctrine...that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one"

---

## 2. Symbolic and Typological References to Christ

### Moses in the Similitude of Christ (Moses 1:6, 13, 16)

**"Thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten"** (mentioned three times)

**Analysis:**
Moses himself becomes a type and shadow of Christ:
- Moses was a deliverer; Christ is THE Deliverer
- Moses brought Israel out of physical bondage; Christ brings us out of spiritual bondage
- Moses was a mediator between God and Israel; Christ is the Mediator
- Moses gave the law; Christ fulfilled the law

**Cross-References:**
- **Deuteronomy 18:15, 18**: "The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me...I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee" (fulfilled in Christ)
- **Acts 3:22-23**: Peter applies this prophecy to Jesus Christ
- **3 Nephi 20:23**: Christ confirms He is the prophet Moses foretold

**Doctrinal Significance:**
When God tells Moses he is "in the similitude of mine Only Begotten," it means:
1. Moses's life and mission foreshadow Christ's life and mission
2. All who see Moses should ultimately think of Christ
3. The greatest prophets point us to the greatest Prophet

**Teaching Application:**
Help family members see that just as Moses was "in the similitude" of Christ, we too are commanded to become like Christ (3 Nephi 27:27). Every disciple should reflect Christ's image.

### Transfiguration as a Type of Resurrection and Glorification (Moses 1:11, 14)

**"For I should have withered and died in his presence; but his glory was upon me; and I beheld his face, for I was transfigured before him."**

**Analysis:**
Moses's transfiguration symbolizes what Christ makes possible:
- Mortal man cannot endure God's glory without divine assistance
- Through Christ's power, we can be changed and glorified
- Transfiguration is a temporary type of the permanent resurrection and exaltation Christ offers

**Cross-References:**
- **Matthew 17:1-2**: Jesus was transfigured before Peter, James, and John (with Moses and Elijah appearing)
- **D&C 76:70**: "These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose glory is that of the sun"
- **1 Corinthians 15:51-52**: "We shall all be changed, In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Only through Christ's Atonement can fallen mortals be transformed and glorified to endure God's presence eternally.

### The Pattern of Revelation: Spiritual Eyes (Moses 1:11)

**"But now mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld"**

**Analysis:**
This teaches that seeing God requires spiritual preparation and Christ's enabling power:
- Natural man cannot see God without dying (Exodus 33:20)
- Christ makes it possible for mortals to see the Father through spiritual transformation
- The veil between mortality and eternity is opened through Christ

**Cross-References:**
- **Ether 12:19**: "Ye have not seen me; wherefore, ye have not believed. But behold, the Lord knoweth all things from the beginning; wherefore, he prepareth a way to accomplish all his works among the children of men; for behold, he hath all power unto the fulfilling of all his words. And thus it is. Amen"
- **D&C 67:10-11**: "And again, verily I say unto you that it is your privilege, and a promise I give unto you that have been ordained unto this ministry, that inasmuch as you strip yourselves from jealousies and fears, and humble yourselves before me...ye shall see me and know that I am"

### The Contrast Between Light and Darkness (Moses 1:12-22)

**Analysis:**
The chapter presents a powerful contrast between encountering God versus encountering Satan:

**Encountering God (Light/Truth/Christ):**
- Glory and transfiguration
- Strength and enlightenment
- Peace and purpose
- Clarity about identity as a son of God

**Encountering Satan (Darkness/Deception):**
- Weakness and fear
- Temptation to worship falsely
- "Darkness unto me" (Moses 1:15)
- Bitterness of hell

**Doctrinal Connection to Christ:**
This contrast symbolizes Christ (the Light of the World) versus Satan (the prince of darkness):
- **John 8:12**: "I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness"
- **D&C 93:2**: "He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light"
- **2 Nephi 2:11**: There must be "opposition in all things"

**Teaching Application:**
Having experienced God's glory, Moses could discern the counterfeit. Those who know Christ can recognize and reject Satan's deceptions.

### Calling Upon the Name of Christ for Deliverance (Moses 1:18, 20, 21)

**Pattern of Deliverance:**
1. Moses faces overwhelming evil (Satan's temptation)
2. He feels fear and sees "the bitterness of hell"
3. He calls upon God in the name of the Only Begotten
4. He receives strength and Satan departs

**Analysis:**
This is a pattern of how Christ delivers us from spiritual bondage:
- We face temptation and evil
- We exercise faith in Christ's name
- We receive divine strength
- Evil loses its power

**Cross-References:**
- **Mosiah 4:2**: "O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ"
- **Alma 36:18**: "And it came to pass that I cried within my heart: O Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me"
- **Helaman 5:12**: "It is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation"

## 3. Doctrinal Connections to Christ's Role

### The Divine Purpose: Immortality and Eternal Life (Moses 1:39)

**"For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."**

**Analysis:**
This is the Father's declaration of His purpose, which is accomplished ONLY through Jesus Christ:

**Immortality (Universal Resurrection):**
- Given freely to all through Christ's unconditional Atonement
- Victory over physical death
- Made possible by Christ's resurrection

**Eternal Life (Exaltation):**
- Conditional upon faith, repentance, and covenant faithfulness
- Life in God's presence
- Made possible through Christ's suffering for our sins

**Cross-References:**
- **1 Corinthians 15:22**: "For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive"
- **D&C 14:7**: "And, if you keep my commandments and endure to the end you shall have eternal life, which gift is the greatest of all the gifts of God"
- **2 Nephi 2:25-27**: "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy. And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
The Father's entire work centers on Christ. Without Christ's Atonement:
- No resurrection (immortality)
- No forgiveness of sins (eternal life)
- No return to God's presence

**Teaching Application:**
When we understand that God's entire purpose is our immortality and eternal life, we see that EVERYTHING He does is motivated by love, accomplished through His Son Jesus Christ.

### Christ as the Source of Strength Against Evil (Moses 1:20-21)

**"Nevertheless, calling upon God, he received strength, and he commanded, saying: Depart from me, Satan...And Moses received strength, and called upon God, saying: In the name of the Only Begotten, depart hence, Satan."**

**Analysis:**
Christ is the source of power to overcome temptation and Satan:
- Moses was weak in himself but strong in Christ
- The name of Christ has inherent power over evil
- Deliverance comes through invoking Christ's name with faith

**Cross-References:**
- **Philippians 4:13**: "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me"
- **Ether 12:27**: "My grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them"
- **Alma 26:12**: "Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things"

### The Restoration of Lost Truths Through Christ's Servants (Moses 1:41)

**"And in a day when the children of men shall esteem my words as naught and take many of them from the book which thou shalt write, behold, I will raise up another like unto thee; and they shall be had again among the children of men"**

**Analysis:**
This prophesies of both the Great Apostasy and the Restoration:
- Plain and precious truths would be lost
- God would raise up another prophet like Moses (Joseph Smith)
- The restoration would come through prophetic authority

**Connection to Christ:**
- The Restoration is Christ's work to bring back His gospel
- Joseph Smith, like Moses, was in the similitude of Christ
- The Book of Mormon is "Another Testament of Jesus Christ"
- The restored gospel centers entirely on Christ's Atonement

**Cross-References:**
- **1 Nephi 13:40**: "These last records...shall establish the truth of the first...and shall make known the plain and precious things which have been taken away from them"
- **D&C 135:3**: "Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it"

## 4. How Moses 1 Testifies of Jesus Christ and His Mission

### Christ as the Mediator

Moses 1 powerfully demonstrates that Jesus Christ is the only way to approach the Father:
- Moses must pray in Christ's name (v. 17)
- The Holy Ghost testifies of both Father and Son (v. 24)
- Access to God's presence requires Christ's enabling power (transfiguration)

**Testimony:**
"There is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ" (Helaman 5:9).

### Christ as Creator

The chapter reveals Christ's divine role in creating "worlds without number":
- Demonstrates His power and authority
- Shows His intimate knowledge of all creation
- Reveals His work is ongoing and eternal

**Testimony:**
The Creator of the universe cares about each individual. He who created worlds without number knows and loves each of us personally.

### Christ as Deliverer

Moses's role as deliverer foreshadows Christ's mission:
- Moses delivered Israel from physical bondage
- Christ delivers all mankind from spiritual bondage
- Both required divine power and authority

**Testimony:**
Just as Moses could not deliver Israel in his own strength, we cannot save ourselves. We need the Deliverer, Jesus Christ.

### Christ as the Source of Grace and Truth

Twice the Father declares the Son is "full of grace and truth" (v. 6, 32):
- Grace = divine enabling power, unmerited favor
- Truth = eternal reality, light, knowledge

**Testimony:**
Christ perfectly balances mercy (grace) and justice (truth). Through Him we receive both forgiveness and transformation.

### Christ Enables Us to Become Like God

Moses was "in the similitude" of Christ, showing the path of discipleship:
- We are to become like Christ (Moroni 7:48)
- Christ makes it possible to endure God's presence
- The ultimate goal is to become joint-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17)

**Testimony:**
Christ not only saves us FROM sin but saves us TO become like God—this is eternal life.

## 5. Key Themes That Point to Christ

### Theme 1: The Divine Sonship

**Verses:** 4, 6, 7, 13, 16, 17, 32, 33

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
- Moses is called "my son" by God (adopted sonship)
- Christ is "mine Only Begotten" (literal divine sonship)
- We too can become sons and daughters of Christ through covenant (Mosiah 5:7)

**Application:**
Understanding our identity as children of God helps us resist temptation (as Moses did in v. 13: "I am a son of God"). This identity comes through Christ's Atonement.

### Theme 2: The Power of Christ's Name

**Verses:** 17, 21, 24

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
- Prayer is offered in Christ's name
- Evil is commanded to depart in Christ's name
- The Spirit testifies of Christ's name

**Application:**
Using Christ's name is not a formula but a relationship. When we truly call upon His name with faith, power attends our prayers and commands.

**Teaching Moment:**
Ask: "Why does Satan tremble at Christ's name?" Because Christ has power over death, hell, and all evil. His name represents His authority, power, and victory.

### Theme 3: The Doctrine of Creation

**Verses:** 27-35

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
- Christ created "worlds without number"
- All creation testifies of Christ
- The vastness of creation shows Christ's infinite power

**Application:**
When we look at the night sky, mountains, or oceans, we can remember that Jesus Christ created them. Everything we see witnesses of Him.

### Theme 4: Man is Nothing—But God Makes Us Something

**Verses:** 10, 13, 20

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
- Moses realizes "man is nothing" in himself (v. 10)
- Yet Moses has divine potential "in the similitude" of Christ
- This paradox is resolved through Christ's grace

**Application:**
We are nothing without Christ but can become everything through Him. This is not self-deprecation but accurate theology—we have nothing to boast of except Christ (2 Nephi 31:19).

**Cross-Reference:**
- **Mosiah 4:5**: "We are less than the dust of the earth"
- **Mosiah 4:6-7**: "Yet we can ask and receive remission of sins"

### Theme 5: The Pattern of Opposition

**Verses:** 12-22

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
- After experiencing God's glory, Moses faces Satan's temptation
- This pattern mirrors Christ's own experience (baptism followed by temptation)
- It also mirrors our mortal journey—opposition follows spiritual experiences

**Application:**
When we feel the Spirit or have sacred experiences, expect opposition. But remember: the power of Christ that strengthens us is greater than Satan's power to tempt us.

**Teaching Moment:**
Moses overcame Satan the same way we can:
1. Remember identity as a child of God (v. 13)
2. Call upon God in Christ's name (v. 18, 20, 21)
3. Command evil to depart (v. 16, 18, 20, 21)
4. Rely on the Holy Ghost (v. 24)

### Theme 6: The Worth of Souls

**Verses:** 28-29, 39

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
- Moses sees souls "numberless as the sand upon the sea shore"
- Yet God knows them all individually
- The Father's work is to bring to pass their immortality and eternal life

**Application:**
If God's work focuses on each individual soul's eternal life, then Christ's Atonement must be infinite yet also deeply personal. He knows and loves each of us.

**Cross-Reference:**
- **D&C 18:10**: "Remember the worth of souls is great in the sight of God"
- **Luke 15**: Parables of the lost sheep, coin, and prodigal son

## Testimony-Building Insights

### The Pre-mortal Christ

Moses 1 shows that Jesus Christ's role as Savior was established long before His birth in Bethlehem. He was foreordained, prepared, and willing from the foundation of the world (1 Peter 1:19-20).

### The Creating Christ

Jesus Christ is not merely a moral teacher or wise philosopher—He is the Creator of worlds without number. This establishes His divine nature, power, and authority as the Son of God.

### The Enabling Christ

Moses could not endure God's presence in his natural state. Christ's power transfigured and strengthened him. Similarly, Christ enables us to do what we cannot do alone—overcome sin, resist temptation, and eventually endure God's eternal presence.

### The Delivering Christ

Just as Moses would deliver Israel from bondage, Christ delivers all mankind from sin and death. This deliverance is not merely physical but spiritual and eternal.

### The Personal Christ

Though Christ created "worlds without number" and knows "innumerable" souls, He knows each of us personally. The Father's work and glory—immortality and eternal life—applies to every individual. Christ's Atonement is both infinite and intimate.

---

## Conclusion: The Christ-Centered Message of Moses 1

Moses 1 is a powerful testament of Jesus Christ. Though Moses speaks face to face with God the Father, the chapter repeatedly points us to the Son:

- Christ is declared to be the Savior (v. 6)
- Christ is full of grace and truth (v. 6, 32)
- Christ is the Creator of all things (v. 32-33)
- Prayer must be offered in Christ's name (v. 17)
- Power over evil comes through Christ's name (v. 21)
- The Holy Ghost testifies of Christ (v. 24)
- All of God's work centers on Christ's mission to bring about immortality and eternal life (v. 39)

### Final Testimony:

Moses 1 teaches that Jesus Christ is the center of all creation, all revelation, all salvation. He is the Only Begotten Son of the Father, the Savior of the world, the Creator of heaven and earth. Through His grace and truth, we can be transfigured, strengthened, and ultimately brought back into the Father's presence to receive immortality and eternal life.

I testify that Jesus Christ lives. He is our Creator, Redeemer, and King. As we study Moses 1 with eyes to see Him, we will find Him on every page, in every verse, and our testimonies will be strengthened in His holy name.
