# Christ-Centered Analysis: Moses 2
## Come Follow Me Week 3 (January 12-18, 2026)
[[Genesis 1-2, Moses 2-3, Abraham 4-5 (Jan 12-18)]]

---

## Overview

Moses 2 is the sacred account of the Creation told from God's perspective, revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai. While often studied for its cosmological insights, this chapter is fundamentally a testimony of Jesus Christ as the Creator of heaven and earth. Every verse witnesses that Jesus Christ—identified in Moses 1:32-33 as the Father's "word of my power" and the "Only Begotten"—organized and created all things under the Father's direction.

This chapter provides unique doctrinal clarity not found in Genesis 1, explicitly identifying the Creator as God's "Only Begotten" (Moses 2:1, 26-27). It reveals the pre-mortal Christ actively speaking, organizing, and blessing creation. Understanding Moses 2 as a testimony of Christ transforms it from a mere account of how the world began to a powerful witness of who made it—and why.

## 1. Direct References to Jesus Christ

### The Only Begotten as Creator (Moses 2:1)

**"AND it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I reveal unto you concerning this heaven, and this earth; write the words which I speak. I am the Beginning and the End, the Almighty God; by mine Only Begotten I created these things; yea, in the beginning I created the heaven, and the earth upon which thou standest."**

**Analysis:**
This opening verse is the theological key to the entire chapter, establishing that:
- **"By mine Only Begotten I created these things"** - The Father created all things through Jesus Christ
- **"I am the Beginning and the End"** - A title Christ shares (Revelation 1:8, 11; 22:13; 3 Nephi 9:18)
- **Creation was accomplished in partnership between Father and Son**

**Doctrinal Significance:**
This verse establishes Christ's divine role as Creator under the Father's direction. Everything that follows—the six days of creation—was accomplished "by" the Only Begotten Son. Every act of creation in this chapter testifies of Christ's power, wisdom, and divine mission.

**Cross-References:**
- **Moses 1:32-33**: "And by the word of my power, have I created them, which is mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth...by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten"
- **John 1:1-3**: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made"
- **Colossians 1:16**: "For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible...all things were created by him, and for him"
- **Hebrews 1:2**: "By whom also he made the worlds"
- **D&C 76:24**: "That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created"

### "Let Us Make Man"—The Divine Council (Moses 2:26)

**"And I, God, said unto mine Only Begotten, which was with me from the beginning: Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and it was so."**

**Analysis:**
This is one of the most explicit testimonies of Christ's pre-mortal existence and creative role:
- **"Mine Only Begotten, which was with me from the beginning"** - Christ's eternal existence
- **"Let us make man"** - The Father and Son counsel together in creating humanity
- **"In our image, after our likeness"** - Both Father and Son serve as the pattern for mankind
- **Direct dialogue between Father and Son is recorded**

This verse transforms Genesis 1:26 by explicitly identifying who the "us" refers to—not angels or a divine council of beings, but specifically the Father speaking to His Only Begotten Son.

**Doctrinal Significance:**
- Christ was "with" the Father "from the beginning"—eternally
- The creation of man was not unilateral but collaborative
- We are created in the image of both the Father and the Son
- This shows the unity and partnership within the Godhead

**Cross-References:**
- **Abraham 4:26**: "And the Gods took counsel among themselves and said: Let us go down and form man in our image, after our likeness"
- **John 1:1-2**: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God...The same was in the beginning with God"
- **Ether 3:15-16**: "Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people...In me shall all mankind have life, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name"

### Man Created in the Image of the Only Begotten (Moses 2:27)

**"And I, God, created man in mine own image, in the image of mine Only Begotten created I him; male and female created I them."**

**Analysis:**
This verse explicitly states that man was created in the image of Christ:
- **"In the image of mine Only Begotten created I him"** - Humans bear Christ's divine image
- This explains why Christ could take upon Himself mortal flesh in the meridian of time
- Christ is the prototype of humanity

**Doctrinal Significance:**
We are literally created in Christ's image, which means:
- Christ has a physical, glorified body in whose likeness we are made
- Our bodies are sacred, patterned after the Creator's body
- Christ could condescend to become mortal because He created us in His own image
- Our divine potential is to become like Christ (Moroni 7:48; 3 Nephi 27:27)

**Cross-References:**
- **Genesis 1:27**: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him"
- **Ether 3:15-17**: The brother of Jared sees Christ's pre-mortal body and learns that man was created in His image
- **D&C 77:2**: Refers to Christ's spiritual and temporal creation
- **Abraham 4:27**: Parallel account emphasizing the Gods' counsel in creating man

**Teaching Application:**
Understanding that we are created in Christ's image gives profound meaning to discipleship. When we seek to become like Christ, we are actually becoming what we were designed to be from the beginning.

## 2. Symbolic and Typological References to Christ

### Christ as the Light of the World (Moses 2:3-5)

**"And I, God, said: Let there be light; and there was light. And I, God, saw the light; and that light was good. And I, God, divided the light from the darkness. And I, God, called the light Day; and the darkness, I called Night."**

**Analysis:**
The first creative act—creating light—is a powerful symbol of Jesus Christ:
- Christ is "the Light of the world" (John 8:12; 9:5)
- Light was the FIRST thing created—Christ is the firstborn of the Father
- Light divides darkness—Christ divides truth from error, good from evil
- Light is declared "good"—Christ is perfectly good

**Symbolic Significance:**
- **Light = Christ, truth, intelligence, glory**
- **Darkness = Satan, ignorance, sin, spiritual death**
- The creation begins with light because all creation testifies of Christ the Light

**Cross-References:**
- **John 1:4-5**: "In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not"
- **John 8:12**: "I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life"
- **D&C 88:6-13**: "He that ascended up on high, as also he descended below all things...This is the light of Christ...which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space"
- **3 Nephi 15:9**: "Behold I am the law, and the light"

**Doctrinal Connection:**
Just as physical light was necessary for physical creation and life, Christ—the spiritual Light—is necessary for spiritual creation and eternal life. Without Christ, all is darkness.

**Teaching Application:**
Ask: "Why did God create light first?" Because light is essential to all life. Similarly, Christ is essential to all spiritual life. Everything in creation testifies that Christ is the Light.

### The Creative Word—"Let There Be...And It Was So" (Throughout Chapter)

**Pattern repeated throughout Moses 2:**
- "And I, God, said: Let there be...and there was" (verses 3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 20, 24, 26)
- "And it was so, even as I spake" (verses 5, 6, 7, 9, 11)

**Analysis:**
Christ is identified as the "Word" of God (John 1:1-3, 14). The pattern of creation by divine command reveals:
- Creation occurred through the spoken word
- Christ is the "word of [the Father's] power" (Moses 1:32)
- Christ's word has creative and organizing power
- Obedience to God's word brings order from chaos

**Symbolic Significance:**
- The creative process mirrors spiritual creation (born again through God's word)
- Just as Christ's word organized the physical creation, His word (the gospel) organizes our spiritual lives
- "Let there be" shows divine will becoming reality—Christ fulfills the Father's will perfectly

**Cross-References:**
- **John 1:1, 3, 14**: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...All things were made by him...And the Word was made flesh"
- **Hebrews 1:3**: "Upholding all things by the word of his power"
- **Hebrews 11:3**: "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God"
- **Jacob 4:9**: "By the power of his word man came upon the face of the earth"

**Teaching Application:**
Christ is the Word through whom all things were made. When we hear and obey His word (the gospel), we participate in our own spiritual creation.

### The Pattern of Six Days and Rest—Christ's Work and Sabbath (Moses 2:1-31)

**Analysis:**
The six days of creation followed by rest (Genesis 2:2-3) symbolize:
- Christ's creative work on our behalf
- The ultimate rest Christ offers to the faithful
- The Sabbath day as a reminder of Christ our Creator

**Symbolic Significance:**
- **Six days of labor = Christ's work to create, redeem, and perfect us**
- **Seventh day rest = Entering into Christ's rest (Alma 12:34; Moroni 7:3; D&C 84:24)**
- The Sabbath points us to Christ who gives us rest from sin, suffering, and spiritual labor

**Cross-References:**
- **Matthew 11:28-30**: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest"
- **Hebrews 4:3-10**: "For we which have believed do enter into rest...There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God"
- **Alma 12:34**: "Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart, he shall have claim on mercy through mine Only Begotten Son, unto a remission of his sins; and these shall enter into my rest"

**Teaching Application:**
The creation account itself teaches us to keep the Sabbath holy in remembrance of Christ our Creator and Redeemer. Entering into His "rest" means entering into His presence.

### "All Things Which I Had Made Were Good" (Moses 2:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31)

**Pattern:** Seven times God declares His creation "good" (and "very good" on the sixth day).

**Analysis:**
This repeated declaration testifies of Christ's perfect work:
- Christ creates only what is good
- The Fall did not make creation evil—it remains Christ's "good" creation
- Christ's creative work reflects His divine nature
- Everything created by Christ has purpose and goodness

**Symbolic Significance:**
- The number seven = completeness, perfection
- Seven declarations of "good" = Christ's work is completely and perfectly good
- This anticipates Christ's Atonement, which is also perfectly good

**Cross-References:**
- **1 Timothy 4:4**: "For every creature of God is good"
- **D&C 59:18-20**: "All things which come of the earth...are made for the benefit and the use of man...to please the eye and to gladden the heart; Yea, for food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul"
- **Genesis 1:31**: "And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good"

**Teaching Application:**
Living in a world created by Christ, we can trust that His creation is good. When we use the earth's resources gratefully and righteously, we honor Christ the Creator.

### The Firmament—Heaven Created to Separate Waters (Moses 2:6-8)

**"And again, I, God, said: Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water, and it was so, even as I spake; and I said: Let it divide the waters from the waters."**

**Analysis:**
While this describes the physical creation of the atmosphere/sky, symbolically it represents:
- Christ organizing and bringing order to chaos
- Separation/division as part of the creative process (later, Christ divides sheep from goats, wheat from tares)
- Heaven created as a boundary between earthly and heavenly realms

**Symbolic Significance:**
Christ creates both physical heaven (sky) and spiritual heaven (celestial kingdom). He provides the way for us to ascend from earth to the heaven of God's presence.

**Cross-References:**
- **Moses 1:10**: "And it came to pass that Moses looked, and beheld the world upon which he was created; and Moses beheld the world and the ends thereof, and all the children of men which are, and which were created; of the same he greatly marveled and wondered"
- **D&C 76**: The vision of the three degrees of glory—heavens created by Christ

### The Sun and Moon—Greater and Lesser Lights (Moses 2:14-18)

**"And I, God, made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and the greater light was the sun, and the lesser light was the moon; and the stars also were made even according to my word."**

**Analysis:**
The sun and moon symbolize Christ and His relationship to creation:
- **The sun (greater light) = Jesus Christ**, the Light of the World, the source of all light and life
- **The moon (lesser light) = The Church, prophets, or scriptures**, which reflect Christ's light
- **Stars = Individual Saints**, who shine with reflected light (Daniel 12:3)

The sun rules the day (light/truth), the moon rules the night (darkness/apostasy)—even in spiritual darkness, there is reflected light to guide us.

**Symbolic Significance:**
- Christ is the source of all light—spiritual and physical
- The Church and prophets do not have their own light but reflect Christ's light
- We too are called to reflect Christ's light to the world (Matthew 5:14-16)

**Cross-References:**
- **Malachi 4:2**: "But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings"
- **Revelation 1:16**: "He had in his right hand seven stars"
- **D&C 76:70**: "Whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest of all"
- **D&C 88:7-13**: "Which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space—The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things"

**Teaching Application:**
Just as the moon has no light of its own but reflects the sun, we have no righteousness of our own but reflect Christ's light. Our purpose is to point others to Christ, the true source of light.

### The Blessing of Fruitfulness (Moses 2:22, 28)

**"And I, God, blessed them, saying: Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the sea; and let fowl multiply in the earth...And I, God, blessed them, and said unto them: Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth."**

**Analysis:**
God blesses His creation with the power to reproduce and multiply. This blessing is a type of:
- Christ's blessing upon the faithful to have eternal increase
- Spiritual multiplication through missionary work and conversion
- The Abrahamic covenant—posterity as numerous as the stars

**Symbolic Significance:**
- Physical fruitfulness points to spiritual fruitfulness
- Christ blesses us with the power to bring forth spiritual children (converts, disciples)
- Eternal increase is one of the blessings of exaltation through Christ

**Cross-References:**
- **D&C 132:19-20**: "They shall pass by the angels...to their exaltation and glory in all things...which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever"
- **John 15:16**: "I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain"
- **Abraham 3:24-25**: The creation's purpose is to test and prove the faithful

**Teaching Application:**
God's first commandment to Adam and Eve was to multiply and replenish. This includes both physical and spiritual increase—raising righteous children and bringing souls to Christ.

### Dominion Over Creation (Moses 2:26, 28)

**"Let them have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."**

**Analysis:**
Dominion given to mankind symbolizes:
- Christ's ultimate dominion over all creation (Psalm 8:6; Hebrews 2:7-9)
- Mankind as stewards (not exploiters) of Christ's creation
- The responsibility that comes with being created in Christ's image

**Symbolic Significance:**
- Christ has "all power...in heaven and in earth" (Matthew 28:18)
- He delegates stewardship to us, His children
- We will be judged on how we use the dominion He has given us
- Righteous dominion mirrors Christ's pattern of servant leadership

**Cross-References:**
- **Psalm 8:4-6**: "What is man, that thou art mindful of him?...Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands"
- **Hebrews 2:7-9**: Applied to Christ, who has dominion over all
- **D&C 121:36-37**: "The rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven"—dominion must be exercised in righteousness
- **Genesis 1:28**: The original commandment to have dominion

**Teaching Application:**
Christ entrusts us with stewardship over His creation. How we treat the earth, animals, and our fellow beings reflects our discipleship. Dominion means responsibility, not exploitation.

## 3. Doctrinal Connections to Christ's Role

### Christ as the Beginning and the End (Moses 2:1)

**"I am the Beginning and the End, the Almighty God; by mine Only Begotten I created these things."**

**Doctrinal Connection:**
This title, shared by both the Father and the Son, establishes Christ's eternal nature:
- **The Beginning** - Christ was foreordained as Savior from the beginning
- **The End** - Christ will bring all things to their eternal conclusion
- He presides over all creation from eternity to eternity

**Cross-References:**
- **Revelation 1:8**: "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord"
- **Revelation 22:13**: "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last"
- **3 Nephi 9:18**: Christ declares, "I am the light and the life of the world. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end"
- **D&C 19:1**: "I am Alpha and Omega, Christ the Lord"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Christ encompasses all of time and creation. Everything begins with Him and culminates in Him. There is no part of creation or eternity that does not center on Jesus Christ.

### The Purpose of Creation—To Bring to Pass God's Work (Moses 1:39 in Context)

**Connection:**
Moses 2 follows immediately after Moses 1:39: **"For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."**

**Analysis:**
The Creation account in Moses 2 must be understood in light of this purpose:
- The earth was created as a testing ground for God's children
- Christ created this world specifically to facilitate our progression
- Every element of creation serves the Father's purpose of bringing to pass our immortality and eternal life

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Creation was not random or purposeless. Christ organized this earth with intentionality:
- **Immortality** - Made possible by Christ's resurrection, which conquers physical death
- **Eternal life** - Made possible by Christ's Atonement, which conquers spiritual death
- Everything created points us toward Christ and our eternal potential

**Cross-References:**
- **2 Nephi 2:25**: "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy"
- **Abraham 3:24-25**: "And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them"
- **D&C 49:16-17**: "Wherefore, it must needs be sanctified from all unrighteousness, that it may be prepared for the celestial glory"

**Teaching Application:**
When we look at creation—mountains, oceans, stars, trees, animals—we can remember that Christ made all of this for us, to help us progress and return to God. Every sunrise testifies of Christ's love and purpose.

### The Pattern of Order from Chaos (Throughout Moses 2)

**Analysis:**
Moses 2:2 describes the earth as "without form, and void"—chaotic, unorganized. Christ then brings order:
- **Day 1:** Light separated from darkness
- **Day 2:** Waters separated—heaven and earth distinguished
- **Day 3:** Land and sea separated; vegetation organized
- **Day 4:** Heavenly lights organized for signs and seasons
- **Day 5:** Waters and sky filled with life
- **Day 6:** Earth filled with life, culminating in mankind

**Doctrinal Connection to Christ:**
This pattern of bringing order from chaos is exactly what Christ does in our lives:
- We begin in spiritual chaos (fallen, sinful, separated from God)
- Christ brings order through His gospel
- He organizes our lives, giving purpose and direction
- He creates us anew (spiritual rebirth)

**Cross-References:**
- **2 Corinthians 5:17**: "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new"
- **Mosiah 5:7**: "And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ"
- **Alma 5:14**: "Have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances?"

**Teaching Application:**
Just as Christ organized the earth from chaos, He can organize our lives. When we feel scattered, purposeless, or broken, Christ can bring order, meaning, and beauty to our existence.

### "And I, God"—The First-Person Account

**Pattern throughout Moses 2:**
God speaks in the first person: "And I, God, said..." (verses 3, 6, 9, 14, 20, 24, 26), "I, God, saw..." (verses 4, 10, 18, 21, 25, 31), "I, God, made..." (verses 7, 16, 25), "I, God, created..." (verse 27)

**Analysis:**
This unique feature of Moses 2 (compared to Genesis 1) makes the account personal and intimate:
- God is not distant or abstract
- The Creator directly addresses Moses (and us)
- We learn of creation directly from the One who created it—Jesus Christ, speaking on behalf of the Father
- This is revelation, not speculation

**Doctrinal Connection:**
Christ is not an impersonal force but a personal God who knows us individually. The same Christ who says "I, God, created man" also says "I, the Lord, know thee by name" (Exodus 33:17; Isaiah 43:1).

**Cross-References:**
- **Moses 1:4-6**: God speaks to Moses face to face
- **John 10:14**: "I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine"
- **D&C 93:1**: "Verily, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name...shall see my face and know that I am"

**Teaching Application:**
The God who created worlds without number knows you by name. The "I, God" who organized creation cares personally about your life. Creation is personal because the Creator is personal.

## 4. How Moses 2 Testifies of Jesus Christ and His Mission

### Christ as the Master Organizer

**Testimony:**
Moses 2 reveals Christ as the divine architect and organizer of creation. He did not create ex nihilo (from nothing) but organized existing matter according to eternal laws and the Father's plan. This testifies that:
- Christ has perfect knowledge and wisdom
- He creates with purpose and intentionality
- Everything has its proper place and function in His plan
- He can organize our lives as He organized creation

### Christ as the Source of Life

**Testimony:**
Christ brings life to all creation:
- Vegetation (verses 11-12)
- Sea creatures and birds (verses 20-21)
- Land animals (verses 24-25)
- Mankind (verses 26-27)

John 1:4 declares: **"In him was life; and the life was the light of men."** Christ is not merely the Creator but the life-giver. Every living thing owes its existence to Him.

**Application:**
Physical life testifies of spiritual life. Just as Christ breathed life into Adam (Moses 3:7), He offers us spiritual life through His Atonement and the gift of the Holy Ghost.

### Christ as the Fulfiller of the Father's Will

**Testimony:**
Moses 2:1 establishes that the Father created "by mine Only Begotten." Throughout the chapter, Christ executes the Father's plan perfectly:
- He speaks: "Let there be"—and it is done
- He creates what the Father directs
- He blesses as the Father commands
- He evaluates: "And I, God, saw that all things which I had made were good"

This pattern testifies that Christ perfectly fulfills the Father's will, foreshadowing His mortal mission: **"I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me"** (John 6:38).

### Christ as the Blesser

**Testimony:**
Twice in Moses 2, God blesses His creation:
- **Verse 22:** Blessing the sea creatures and birds to multiply
- **Verse 28:** Blessing mankind to be fruitful, multiply, and have dominion

These blessings testify that Christ desires to bless, not curse; to build up, not tear down. His creative work is filled with generosity and abundance.

**Cross-References:**
- **3 Nephi 17:21**: Christ blessing the children one by one
- **D&C 130:20-21**: "There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated"

**Application:**
Christ's nature is to bless. When we align our lives with His will, we open ourselves to the blessings He desires to pour out upon us.

### Christ's Glory in Creation

**Testimony:**
Seven times, God declares His creation "good"—and once "very good" (verse 31). This repetition testifies:
- Christ's work is perfect
- Creation reflects His divine nature
- Everything He does is "good"—morally, aesthetically, functionally

When we look at the beauty of creation—sunsets, mountains, oceans, forests—we are seeing the glory of Jesus Christ made manifest. Creation is Christ's autobiography written in physical form.

**Cross-References:**
- **Psalm 19:1**: "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork"
- **Romans 1:20**: "For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead"
- **D&C 88:45-47**: "The earth rolls upon her wings, and the sun giveth his light by day...and these are one planet; and they give light to each other in their times and in their seasons"

---

## 5. Key Themes That Point to Christ

### Theme 1: Divine Partnership—Father and Son

**Verses:** 1, 26

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
- The Father and Son work together in perfect unity
- "Let us make man"—divine collaboration
- This foreshadows Christ's mortal mission: "I and my Father are one" (John 10:30)

**Application:**
Unity in the Godhead is the pattern for unity in families, marriages, and the Church. As the Father and Son work together, so should we work in partnership with Christ.

**Teaching Moment:**
Ask: "Why did the Father create through the Son instead of creating directly?" To establish Christ's authority, to demonstrate divine partnership, and to show that all things come to us through Christ.

### Theme 2: The Power of the Spoken Word

**Pattern:** "And I, God, said...and it was so" (throughout chapter)

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
- Christ is the Word made flesh (John 1:14)
- His word has creative power
- Obedience to His word brings order and life

**Application:**
When we hear Christ's word (through scriptures, prophets, the Spirit) and obey, we participate in spiritual creation. His word creates new hearts, new minds, new lives.

**Cross-References:**
- **Alma 5:7**: "Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep"
- **D&C 11:2**: "Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God...I am the light and the life of the world"

### Theme 3: Progressive Organization—Line Upon Line

**Pattern:** Creation occurs in stages over six days

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
- Christ organizes progressively, not instantaneously
- Each day builds upon the previous day
- This mirrors our spiritual progression—"line upon line, precept upon precept" (2 Nephi 28:30)

**Application:**
Just as creation was progressive, so is our spiritual development. Christ doesn't expect perfection immediately but works with us patiently, day by day, step by step.

**Teaching Moment:**
Creation took six days not because God lacked power, but because organization requires progression. Similarly, our sanctification is a process, not an event.

### Theme 4: Abundance and Generosity

**Verses:** 11-12 (every herb, every tree), 20-21 (waters brought forth abundantly), 29-30 (every herb for food)

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
- Christ creates with abundance, not scarcity
- "Waters brought forth abundantly"
- Every need provided for

**Application:**
Christ's nature is generosity. He provides abundantly—both physically and spiritually. There is no scarcity in His kingdom.

**Cross-References:**
- **John 10:10**: "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly"
- **Ephesians 3:20**: "Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think"
- **2 Nephi 26:33**: "He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world"

### Theme 5: The Sacredness of the Body

**Verses:** 26-27 (created in God's image, after His likeness)

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
- Our bodies are patterned after Christ's glorified body
- The physical body is sacred, not evil
- Christ would take upon Himself a body of flesh to fulfill His mission

**Application:**
Because we are created in Christ's image, our bodies are sacred. We honor Christ when we care for our bodies as temples and use them to serve others.

**Cross-References:**
- **1 Corinthians 6:19-20**: "Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost...therefore glorify God in your body"
- **D&C 88:15**: "The spirit and the body are the soul of man"
- **D&C 93:33-34**: "For man is spirit. The elements are eternal...spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy"

**Teaching Moment:**
Christ created our bodies in His own image. When we treat our bodies with respect and use them righteously, we honor the Creator.

### Theme 6: Patterns and Order

**Verses:** "After his kind" (mentioned 10 times: verses 11, 12, 21, 24, 25)

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
- Christ creates according to patterns and laws
- Everything reproduces "after his kind"—eternal laws govern creation
- This testifies of Christ's order, consistency, and reliability

**Application:**
We can trust Christ because He operates according to eternal law. His promises are sure because He is bound by His own word (D&C 82:10).

**Cross-References:**
- **D&C 130:20-21**: "There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven...And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated"
- **Alma 42:22-25**: God's mercy and justice work in perfect harmony

## 7. Testimony-Building Insights

### The Pre-Mortal Christ Creating

Moses 2 takes us back before mortality, before the Fall, before Adam and Eve walked in the Garden. We witness the pre-mortal Christ actively creating under the Father's direction. This testifies:
- Christ existed before His birth in Bethlehem
- His divine nature and power were manifest from eternity
- He was foreordained as Creator and Savior
- Everything about His mortal mission was planned and purposeful

### The Creating Christ Reveals His Character

How Christ creates reveals who He is:
- **Generous** - He creates abundantly
- **Orderly** - Everything has its place and purpose
- **Patient** - He creates progressively, day by day
- **Collaborative** - He works in unity with the Father
- **Personal** - He speaks in first person: "I, God"
- **Good** - Everything He makes is good

### The Practical Christ

Christ didn't create an abstract, philosophical world. He created:
- Food for eating (herbs, fruits, seeds)
- Light for seeing (sun, moon, stars)
- Animals for companionship and use
- A beautiful world to enjoy

This testifies that Christ cares about our practical, daily needs. He is not distant but intimately involved in providing for us.

### The Purposeful Christ

Moses 2 must be read in light of Moses 1:39—**"This is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."**

Every element of creation serves this purpose:
- The earth provides a place for testing and growth
- Physical bodies enable progression and joy
- Mortality prepares us for immortality
- All creation points us back to the Creator

**Testimony:** Christ created this world with you in mind. You are not an accident or afterthought. The same Christ who organized the cosmos knows your name, your struggles, your potential.

### The Testifying Christ

Romans 1:20 teaches: **"For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead."**

Creation is Christ's testimony:
- Every sunset declares His beauty
- Every mountain testifies of His majesty
- Every star witnesses of His infinite power
- Every flower shows His attention to detail
- Every newborn child proves His love of life

The world around us continually testifies: Jesus Christ is the Creator, the Life-Giver, the source of all that is good.

## 8. Deeper Reflections and Insights

### Why Does Moses 2 Repeat "And I, God"?

The phrase "I, God" appears over 30 times in Moses 2. This is not repetitive or redundant—it's revelatory:
- God is claiming ownership and responsibility for creation
- He is not distant but personally involved
- Each "I, God" reminds us: the Creator knows us personally
- This prepares us for the Incarnation—when "I, God" becomes "I, the Son of Man"

### The Christological Reading of "Let Us Make Man"

Moses 2:26 explicitly reveals that the "us" in "Let us make man" refers to the Father speaking to His Only Begotten Son:
- This resolves centuries of confusion about Genesis 1:26
- It establishes Christ's pre-mortal existence and divine role
- It shows that the creation of mankind was collaborative
- It means we are patterned after both Father and Son

**Profound Implication:** When we see Jesus Christ in the scriptures (especially in His mortal ministry), we are seeing the very image in which we were created. Christ's mortal body revealed what we were created to become.

### The Seven "Goods" and Christ's Perfect Work

God declares His creation "good" seven times (verses 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31):
- Seven = completeness, perfection in scriptural symbolism
- This testifies that Christ's work is completely and perfectly good
- The seventh "good" is "very good"—emphasizing the crowning achievement of man

**Connection to the Atonement:** Just as Christ's creative work is perfectly good, so is His redemptive work. The same Christ who created perfectly also redeems perfectly.

### Creation as Separation and Distinction

Notice how often Christ separates and distinguishes:
- Light from darkness (verse 4)
- Waters from waters (verse 6)
- Dry land from sea (verse 9)
- Day from night (verses 14, 18)

**Symbolic Meaning:** Christ brings clarity and distinction. In our lives, He helps us separate:
- Truth from error
- Good from evil
- The sacred from the profane
- The eternal from the temporal

Just as chaos becomes cosmos through Christ's organizing power, our confused lives become ordered through His gospel.

### "In the Image of Mine Only Begotten"

Moses 2:27 is one of the most profound verses in all scripture: **"In the image of mine Only Begotten created I him."**

This means:
- Christ has a physical, glorified body (not just a spirit)
- Our bodies are patterned after His body
- The Incarnation was possible because we were created in His image
- Our mortal bodies foreshadow our potential resurrected, glorified bodies

**Teaching Insight:** This verse bridges creation and incarnation. Christ could take upon Himself mortal flesh because He had created mortality in His own image. His mortal body wasn't foreign—it was a return to the pattern He Himself established.

## 9. Conclusion: The Christ-Centered Message of Moses 2

Moses 2 is far more than an ancient creation account. It is a profound, multi-layered testimony of Jesus Christ:

**Christ is the Creator** - "By mine Only Begotten I created these things" (verse 1)
**Christ is the Word** - All things made through His spoken word (throughout)
**Christ is the Light** - The first creation, symbolizing His role as Light of the World (verses 3-5)
**Christ is the Life** - All living things receive life through Him (verses 20-28)
**Christ is the Image** - We are created in His divine image (verse 27)
**Christ is the Beginning and the End** - He encompasses all creation from eternity to eternity (verse 1)
**Christ is Good** - Everything He creates is good, testifying of His perfect nature (seven declarations)

### The Creation Account Points Us to the Creator

When we study Moses 2 with Christ-centered eyes, we see beyond the "what" to the "Who":
- Not just "What was created?" but "Who created it?"—Jesus Christ
- Not just "How was it created?" but "Why was it created?"—To fulfill the Father's plan through the Son
- Not just "When was it created?" but "For whom?"—For us, God's children

### Every Element of Creation Testifies of Christ

As we walk through this world created by Christ, we can see His testimony everywhere:
- **The rising sun** reminds us He is the Light of the World
- **The mountains** testify of His majesty and strength
- **The oceans** witness of His infinite power
- **The stars** declare His glory and omnipresence
- **The trees** show His pattern of growth and seasons
- **The animals** reveal His creativity and attention to detail
- **Our own bodies** bear witness we are created in His divine image

### An Invitation to Worship the Creator

Moses 2 invites us to:
- **Recognize** Jesus Christ as the Creator of heaven and earth
- **Reverence** His creation as a testimony of His power and love
- **Respond** by becoming good stewards of what He has created
- **Rejoice** in the abundant blessings He provides
- **Return** to Him, our Creator, through faith and obedience

### Final Testimony

I testify that Jesus Christ is the Creator of all things. He is the Only Begotten Son of God, through whom the Father created the heavens and the earth. Every element of creation—from the vast galaxies to the smallest flower—bears witness of His power, wisdom, and love.

The same Christ who said "Let there be light" also said "I am the light of the world." The same Christ who created our bodies in His image came to earth and took upon Himself a mortal body that He might redeem us. The same Christ who created this earth as our testing place will redeem it and make it a celestial kingdom.

As we study Moses 2, we learn not only how the world was created but who created it and why. Jesus Christ created this beautiful world so that we, His brothers and sisters, might experience mortality, learn and grow, and ultimately return to live with Him and the Father forever.

May we see Christ in all creation and worship Him as our Creator, Redeemer, and King.
