# Christ-Centered Analysis: Abraham 4
## Come Follow Me Week 3 (January 12-18, 2026)
[[Genesis 1-2, Moses 2-3, Abraham 4-5 (Jan 12-18)]]

---

## Overview

Abraham 4 is one of the most Christ-revealing chapters in all scripture. While Genesis 1 and Moses 2 describe the creation using singular pronouns ("God said"), Abraham 4 unveils the profound reality of the pre-mortal Council in Heaven, showing "the Gods" (plural) counseling together about the creation. This unique perspective reveals Jesus Christ's active role as one of the "noble and great ones" working under the Father's direction to prepare the earth for mortality.

The chapter repeatedly uses the phrase "the Gods" (at least 24 times), revealing the divine council of Father, Son, and others planning the creation. The opening verse declares, "Let us go down"—Christ's willing descent to organize the earth. The purpose statement in verse 26—"Let us go down and form man"—and the concluding phrase "we will prove them herewith" (Abraham 3:25) reveal that creation itself was Christocentric: designed to test humanity and make possible our return to God through Christ's Atonement.

## 1. Direct References to Jesus Christ

### "Let Us Go Down" - Christ's Willing Descent (Abraham 4:1)

**"AND then the Lord said: Let us go down. And they went down at the beginning, and they, that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens and the earth."**

**Analysis:**
This opening verse is theologically profound:
- **"The Lord said: Let us go down"** - The Father invites the council to descend
- **"They went down"** - Christ and others accepted the invitation
- **"The Gods organized and formed"** - Plural, showing Christ working alongside the Father

**Connection to Christ:**
This echoes Abraham 3:24-25, where Christ (one of the "noble and great ones") says, "We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith."

Christ's willingness to "go down" at the beginning of creation foreshadows His greater condescension when He would "go down" to be born as a mortal, suffer, die, and atone for our sins.

**Cross-References:**
- **Philippians 2:6-8**: "Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant...he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death"
- **1 Nephi 11:16-21**: The angel asks Nephi, "Knowest thou the condescension of God?" showing Christ's descent from heaven to mortality
- **D&C 93:7-10**: "And he received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace...until he received a fulness"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Christ's entire mission is characterized by condescension—going down. He descended to organize the earth, descended to be born in a manger, descended below all things in Gethsemane and Calvary (D&C 122:8), so that He might lift us up to exaltation.

### "The Gods" - Revealing the Divine Council (Used 24 Times Throughout)

**Verses using "the Gods":** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31

**Analysis:**
The repeated use of "the Gods" reveals:
- The Father and the Son working in perfect unity
- The pre-mortal Jesus Christ actively participating in creation
- Possible involvement of other exalted beings in the council
- The pattern of divine counsel before divine action

**Connection to Christ:**
This fulfills what other scriptures teach about Christ as Creator:
- **John 1:1-3**: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God...All things were made by him"
- **Colossians 1:16**: "For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth"
- **Moses 1:32-33**: "By the word of my power, have I created them, which is mine Only Begotten Son...by the Son I created them"
- **D&C 76:24**: "That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
The plural "Gods" does not suggest polytheism but reveals:
1. The unity of the Godhead (Father, Son, Holy Ghost working as one)
2. Christ's divine status as Creator alongside the Father
3. The pattern of divine council and agency in God's work
4. That Christ has always been working to accomplish the Father's plan

**Teaching Application:**
Help others see that Jesus Christ was not an afterthought or backup plan. He was actively involved from the very beginning, working with the Father to create the conditions necessary for our mortal probation and eventual exaltation.

### "Let Us Go Down and Form Man in Our Image" (Abraham 4:26-27)

**"And the Gods took counsel among themselves and said: Let us go down and form man in our image, after our likeness; and we will give them dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So the Gods went down to organize man in their own image, in the image of the Gods to form they him, male and female to form they them."**

**Analysis:**
This reveals the divine council's deliberation about creating mankind:
- **"Took counsel among themselves"** - The Father and Son deliberated together
- **"Let us go down and form man"** - Another descent, this time to create humanity
- **"In our image, after our likeness"** - Humanity bears the image of both Father and Son
- **"Male and female"** - Both genders reflect the divine image

**Connection to Christ:**
This passage reveals several Christ-centered truths:

1. **Christ participated in creating mankind** - We owe our very existence to Him
2. **We are created in Christ's image** - He is the prototype of the perfect human
3. **Christ's image includes both male and female** - All humanity reflects divinity
4. **The purpose was to enable godhood** - We are created in Their image to become like Them

**Cross-References:**
- **Genesis 1:26-27**: "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness"
- **Ether 3:15-16**: "Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit...even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh"
- **Romans 8:29**: "For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son"
- **Moroni 7:48**: "Pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Because we are created in Christ's image, we have the potential to become like Him. The creation of man was not random but purposeful—designed to enable children of God to gain physical bodies, experience mortality, and through Christ's Atonement, return to God's presence and become like Him.

### "We Will Prove Them Herewith" - The Purpose of Creation (Abraham 3:25, Contextual to Abraham 4)

**"And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them."**

**Analysis:**
Though this verse appears in Abraham 3, it provides the theological foundation for all of Abraham 4. The creation was not merely to make a beautiful world but to create conditions for:
- Testing and proving God's children
- Providing opportunities to exercise agency
- Making possible the need for a Savior
- Enabling progression toward godhood

**Connection to Christ:**
The very purpose of creation—to "prove them"—necessitates a Redeemer:
- Mortality would bring sin and death
- A Savior would be needed to overcome both
- Christ volunteered to be that Savior (Abraham 3:27)
- The entire plan of creation was Christocentric

**Cross-References:**
- **Abraham 3:27**: "And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me"
- **2 Nephi 2:22-25**: "And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen...And they would have had no children...Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy"
- **Alma 34:9**: "For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Creation and Atonement are inseparably connected. Christ created the earth knowing full well He would need to redeem it. His creative work at the beginning anticipated His redemptive work in the meridian of time.

## 2. Symbolic and Typological References to Christ

### The Pattern of "They Ordered...and They Obeyed" (Used Throughout)

**Verses:** 7, 9, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31

**Repeated phrases:**
- "It was so as they ordered" (v. 9)
- "The Gods saw that they were obeyed" (v. 10, 12, 18)
- "The Gods saw they would obey" (v. 21, 25)
- "The Gods saw that they would be obeyed" (v. 21)
- "Behold, they shall be very obedient" (v. 31)

**Analysis:**
This unique pattern in Abraham 4 (not found in Genesis 1 or Moses 2) reveals:
- Creation responded to the Gods' commands
- Order, law, and obedience characterize God's work
- Everything created fulfills its divinely appointed purpose

**Connection to Christ:**
This pattern of divine command and obedient response symbolizes Jesus Christ's perfect obedience to the Father:

1. **Christ Himself perfectly obeyed the Father:**
   - John 6:38: "For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me"
   - Philippians 2:8: "And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross"
   - 3 Nephi 11:11: "Behold, I am Jesus Christ, whom the prophets testified shall come into the world"

2. **All creation testifies of Christ's obedience:**
   - If rocks, water, light, and animals obey divine commands, how much more should we?
   - Christ is the perfect example of obedience
   - Through Christ, we can learn to align our will with God's

**Cross-References:**
- **Hebrews 5:8-9**: "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him"
- **D&C 88:40-41**: "For intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light"

**Teaching Application:**
Just as creation obeyed the Gods' commands perfectly, Christ perfectly obeyed the Father. We are invited to follow Christ's example of willing obedience to divine direction.

### Light Divided from Darkness (Abraham 4:3-5)

**"And they (the Gods) said: Let there be light; and there was light. And they (the Gods) comprehended the light, for it was bright; and they divided the light, or caused it to be divided, from the darkness. And the Gods called the light Day, and the darkness they called Night."**

**Analysis:**
The creation of light and its division from darkness is deeply symbolic:
- Light is created first, before all else
- Light is "comprehended" by the Gods
- Light and darkness are separated and named

**Connection to Christ:**
Jesus Christ is the Light that dispels spiritual darkness:

**Christ as the Light:**
- **John 1:4-5**: "In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not"
- **John 8:12**: "I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life"
- **3 Nephi 11:11**: "I am the light and the life of the world"
- **D&C 88:6-13**: "He that ascended up on high, as also he descended below all things, in that he comprehended all things...Which light proceedeth forth from the presence of God to fill the immensity of space—The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things"

**Symbolic Significance:**
- Physical light symbolizes Christ, the spiritual Light
- The division of light from darkness represents Christ separating truth from error, good from evil
- Just as physical light makes physical life possible, Christ's spiritual light makes spiritual life possible

**Cross-References:**
- **D&C 93:2**: "And that I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world"
- **Alma 38:9**: "Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day"

### The Expanse Dividing Waters from Waters (Abraham 4:6-8)

**"And the Gods also said: Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and it shall divide the waters from the waters."**

**Analysis:**
The expanse (firmament/heaven) creates order by separating:
- Waters above from waters below
- Heaven from earth
- Chaos from order

**Connection to Christ:**
Christ is the mediator who bridges the separation between heaven and earth:

**Christ as the Bridge:**
- He descended from heaven to earth
- He provides the way for us to ascend from earth to heaven
- He is the "ladder" Jacob saw (Genesis 28:12; John 1:51)
- He is the "way" between God and man (John 14:6)

**Symbolic Significance:**
Just as the expanse both separates and connects waters above and below, Christ both acknowledges our fallen state (separation from God) while providing the means of reconciliation (connection to God).

**Cross-References:**
- **1 Timothy 2:5**: "For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus"
- **Hebrews 9:15**: "And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament"
- **D&C 76:69**: "These are they who are just men made perfect through Jesus the mediator of the new covenant"

### Bringing Forth Life "After His Kind" (Abraham 4:11-12, 21, 24-25)

**Pattern repeated:**
- Grass, herbs, and trees bring forth "after his kind" (v. 11-12)
- Sea creatures and birds bring forth "after their kind" (v. 21)
- Beasts and cattle bring forth "after their kind" (v. 24-25)

**Analysis:**
This principle of reproduction "after his kind" appears repeatedly, emphasizing:
- Divine order and law
- Each creation fulfilling its purpose
- The continuity of divine design

**Connection to Christ:**
This principle points to Christ in several ways:

1. **Christ enables us to become "after His kind":**
   - We are created in God's image (v. 26-27)
   - Through Christ's Atonement, we can become like Him
   - We can be "born again" as children of Christ (Mosiah 5:7)
   - We can inherit divine nature (2 Peter 1:4)

2. **Christ is the "firstborn" of many brethren:**
   - Romans 8:29: "For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren"
   - Colossians 1:18: "And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead"

3. **The pattern teaches eternal progression:**
   - Gods beget gods
   - Christ makes it possible for us to become "after His kind"
   - This is the purpose of creation and the Atonement

**Cross-References:**
- **Mosiah 27:25**: "And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters"
- **D&C 76:58**: "Wherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of God"
- **D&C 132:20**: "Then shall they be gods, because they have no end"

**Teaching Application:**
Just as plants bring forth "after their kind," God's children have potential to become "after His kind." This is made possible only through Jesus Christ's Atonement, which bridges the gap between our fallen state and our divine potential.

### Man Created in the Divine Image - The Ultimate Type of Christ (Abraham 4:26-27)

**"So the Gods went down to organize man in their own image, in the image of the Gods to form they him, male and female to form they them."**

**Analysis:**
Humanity is unique in creation:
- Only humans are created in God's image
- Only humans have divine potential
- Only humans can become like God

**Connection to Christ:**
Man being created in God's image points to Christ in multiple ways:

1. **Christ is the perfect image of God:**
   - Colossians 1:15: "Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature"
   - Hebrews 1:3: "Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person"
   - 2 Corinthians 4:4: "The light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God"

2. **We are created in Christ's image to become like Him:**
   - We bear His image physically (born in His likeness)
   - We can bear His image spiritually (born again)
   - We are commanded to become like Him (3 Nephi 27:27)

3. **Christ became like us so we could become like Him:**
   - Philippians 2:7: "Made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men"
   - Hebrews 2:17: "Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren"

**Cross-References:**
- **Alma 5:14, 19**: "Have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances?"
- **3 Nephi 27:27**: "Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am"

## 3. Doctrinal Connections to Christ's Role

### Christ as Co-Creator with the Father

**Throughout Abraham 4, the plural "the Gods" establishes:**

1. **Christ's divine status:**
   - He is not merely a created being but a Creator
   - He works alongside the Father as an equal in executing the plan
   - He possesses divine power and authority

2. **Christ's intimate knowledge of creation:**
   - Having created all things, He understands mortality perfectly
   - He knows the challenges we face because He designed the test
   - His Atonement accounts for every condition of mortal life

3. **Christ's preparation for His mortal mission:**
   - Creating the earth prepared Him to redeem it
   - Organizing physical life prepared Him to organize spiritual life
   - Forming man in Their image prepared Him to perfectly exemplify that image

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Christ's role as Creator gives Him unique authority as Redeemer. He owns the earth by right of creation and redeems it by right of the Atonement.

**Cross-References:**
- **D&C 45:1**: "Listen to him who is the advocate with the Father, who is pleading your cause before him—Saying: Father, behold the sufferings and death of him who did no sin, in whom thou wast well pleased; behold the blood of thy Son which was shed, the blood of him whom thou gavest that thyself might be glorified"

### The Pre-mortal Council and Christ's Foreordination

**Abraham 4 reveals the divine council in action, which connects to Abraham 3:22-28:**

**Abraham 3:27-28 provides the context for Abraham 4:**
"And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And another answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first. And the second was angry, and kept not his first estate; and, at that day, many followed after him."

**Connection to Creation:**
- The council decided to create an earth
- The council determined the need for a Savior
- Christ volunteered to be that Savior
- The creation of the earth (Abraham 4) was the execution of the plan accepted in the council (Abraham 3)

**Doctrinal Significance:**

1. **Christ's sacrifice was voluntary, not forced:**
   - He said, "Here am I, send me"
   - His entire mission was an act of pure love and agency
   - Every act of creation was an act of willing service

2. **Creation and Atonement are part of one unified plan:**
   - The earth was created specifically to enable the plan of salvation
   - Christ knew before creating the earth that He would need to redeem it
   - Every element of creation serves the purpose of exaltation

3. **The pattern of divine counsel:**
   - The Father presides but invites counsel
   - The Son willingly participates and executes the Father's will
   - Unity characterizes the work of the Gods

**Cross-References:**
- **1 Peter 1:19-20**: "But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world"
- **Revelation 13:8**: "The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world"
- **Ether 3:14**: "Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people"

**Teaching Application:**
Help others understand that Jesus Christ was not an emergency backup plan. Before the earth was created, He volunteered to be our Savior. Every step of creation was undertaken with His future Atonement in mind.

### The Purpose of Creation: Testing and Proving Humanity

**Abraham 3:25 states the purpose that Abraham 4 fulfills:**
"And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them."

**Analysis:**
Creation was purposeful, designed to:
- Test God's children through agency
- Provide experiences necessary for progression
- Create conditions requiring a Savior
- Enable mortality as a proving ground

**Connection to Christ:**
The very design of creation necessitates Christ's Atonement:

1. **Mortality brings physical death:**
   - Only Christ's resurrection can overcome this
   - All creation groans under the curse of death (Romans 8:22)
   - Christ liberates creation from death's bondage

2. **Mortality brings spiritual death (separation from God):**
   - Only Christ's Atonement can reconcile us to God
   - Sin makes us "unclean" and unable to dwell with God
   - Christ cleanses and sanctifies us

3. **The test requires the possibility of failure:**
   - Agency means we can choose wrong
   - Justice demands consequences for sin
   - Mercy (through Christ) provides escape from those consequences

4. **The purpose is to become like God:**
   - This requires a perfect exemplar (Christ)
   - This requires divine assistance (Christ's grace)
   - This requires infinite sacrifice (Christ's Atonement)

**Cross-References:**
- **2 Nephi 2:11-13**: "For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things...there is a God, and he hath created all things...and to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man"
- **Alma 42:15**: "And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world"
- **D&C 122:7-9**: "And if thou shouldst be cast into the pit, or into the hands of murderers...all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good. The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
The creation itself testifies of Christ because the entire purpose of creation—to prove us—requires a Savior. Without Christ's Atonement, the plan of creation would result in universal damnation. The earth was created because Christ had already agreed to redeem it.

### The Pattern of Divine Unity: "The Gods Took Counsel" (Abraham 4:26)

**"And the Gods took counsel among themselves and said: Let us go down and form man in our image, after our likeness."**

**Analysis:**
Before creating man (the pinnacle of creation), the Gods counseled together, showing:
- Unity in purpose
- Deliberation before action
- Shared decision-making
- Perfect harmony

**Connection to Christ:**
This pattern reveals Christ's relationship with the Father:

1. **Perfect unity:**
   - John 10:30: "I and my Father are one"
   - John 17:21-22: "That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee...that they may be one, even as we are one"

2. **Shared purpose:**
   - John 5:19: "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise"
   - Moses 1:39: "For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man"

3. **Pattern for us:**
   - We are invited to become one with Christ as He is one with the Father
   - D&C 50:43-44: "And the Father and I are one. I am in the Father and the Father in me; and inasmuch as ye have received me, ye are in me and I in you"

**Teaching Application:**
The divine council pattern teaches that God works through unity, not compulsion. Christ exemplifies perfect unity with the Father, and we are invited into that unity through covenant relationship with Christ.

---

## 4. How Abraham 4 Testifies of Jesus Christ and His Mission

### Christ as the Willing Volunteer

Abraham 4:1 states, "Let us go down. And they went down," which fulfills Christ's volunteer statement in Abraham 3:27: "Here am I, send me."

**Testimony:**
Jesus Christ did not create the earth grudgingly or by compulsion. He willingly descended, willingly created, willingly organized, and ultimately willingly suffered and died. His entire mission is characterized by voluntary, loving service.

### Christ as the Divine Creator

The repeated phrase "the Gods" throughout Abraham 4 establishes Christ's divine status. He is not a created being but the Creator. He is not subject to the earth but sovereign over it.

**Testimony:**
The same Jesus who was born in a manger created the very earth on which that manger rested. The same Jesus who died on a cross created the tree from which that cross was hewn. The Creator submitted to His creation to redeem it.

### Christ as the Author of Divine Order

The pattern "they ordered...and they obeyed" shows that Christ establishes order, law, and purpose. Creation is not chaotic but perfectly organized according to divine will.

**Testimony:**
Just as Christ organized the physical creation with perfect order, He organizes our spiritual lives with perfect wisdom. His commandments are not arbitrary but divinely designed for our growth and progression.

### Christ as the Light of Life

The creation of light (Abraham 4:3-5) symbolizes Christ's role as the spiritual light that gives life to all things.

**Testimony:**
As the Light of the World, Jesus Christ dispels spiritual darkness, reveals truth, and illuminates the path back to the Father. Without Him, we would remain in darkness.

### Christ as the Divine Prototype

Man created "in the image of the Gods" (Abraham 4:26-27) reveals that we are created in Christ's image and have potential to become like Him.

**Testimony:**
Jesus Christ is the perfect example of what we can become. He descended below all things so that He could lift us to become like Him. Our divine potential is realized only through Him.

### Christ as the Purpose of Creation

The entire creation was undertaken with the knowledge that humanity would need a Savior. Christ volunteered before the earth was created, knowing the cost.

**Testimony:**
Every sunset, every mountain, every ocean, every star testifies that Jesus Christ loves us enough to create a beautiful world for our mortal probation, knowing He would need to suffer to redeem us from our sins in that world.

## 5. Key Themes That Point to Christ

### Theme 1: The Condescension of Christ

**Verses:** 1, 26

**Key Phrase:** "Let us go down"

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
Christ's entire mission is characterized by descending:
- From heaven to organize the earth
- From heaven to be born in mortality
- From life to death
- Below all things in the Atonement

Each descent enables our ascent.

**Application:**
When we feel overwhelmed by trials, remember: Christ descended below all things so that He could lift us above all things. His condescension makes our exaltation possible.

**Cross-References:**
- **D&C 122:8**: "The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?"
- **Philippians 2:5-11**: "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God...made himself of no reputation...and became obedient unto death...Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him"

### Theme 2: Divine Council and Unity

**Verses:** 1, 26

**Key Phrases:** "The Gods took counsel among themselves," "Let us go down"

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
The Father and Son work in perfect unity:
- They counsel together
- They decide together
- They act together
- They are perfectly one in purpose

**Application:**
We are invited into this unity through covenant relationship with Christ. As we become one with Christ, we become one with the Father.

**Teaching Moment:**
Ask: "What does it mean that 'the Gods took counsel'? Does this mean they disagreed or needed to convince each other?" No—perfect beings in perfect unity still counsel together because this is the pattern of godhood. It teaches respect, collaboration, and shared purpose.

**Cross-References:**
- **John 17:20-23**: Christ's intercessory prayer for unity
- **4 Nephi 1:15**: "And it came to pass that there was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people"

### Theme 3: Order and Obedience

**Verses:** Throughout, especially 7, 9, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31

**Key Phrases:** "They ordered...and they obeyed," "The Gods saw that they were obeyed"

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
Christ is the perfect exemplar of obedience to divine law:
- Creation obeyed the Gods perfectly
- Christ obeyed the Father perfectly
- We are invited to follow Christ's example of obedience

**Application:**
When commandments feel difficult, remember: all creation obeys God's commands perfectly. Christ obeyed perfectly. Through His grace, we can align our will with God's.

**Cross-References:**
- **Hebrews 5:8-9**: "Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered; And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him"
- **D&C 130:20-21**: "There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated—And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated"

### Theme 4: Light and Life

**Verses:** 3-5 (light), 11-12 (plant life), 20-22 (animal life), 26-28 (human life)

**Key Concept:** Light precedes and enables all life

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
Jesus Christ is the Light and the Life:
- Physical light was created first
- All life depends on light
- Christ is the spiritual Light that gives eternal life

**Application:**
Just as plants cannot grow without sunlight, we cannot progress spiritually without Christ's light. He is the source of all life—physical, spiritual, and eternal.

**Cross-References:**
- **John 1:4**: "In him was life; and the life was the light of men"
- **John 8:12**: "I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life"
- **3 Nephi 11:11**: "I am the light and the life of the world"

**Teaching Moment:**
Object lesson: Show how plants grow toward light. Explain that just as plants naturally grow toward physical light, we should naturally grow toward Christ, the spiritual Light.

### Theme 5: Creation "After His Kind"

**Verses:** 11-12, 21, 24-25

**Key Principle:** Everything reproduces "after his kind"

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
We are created in God's image with potential to become "after His kind":
- Plants bring forth after their kind
- Animals bring forth after their kind
- God's children can become like their Heavenly Parents
- This is made possible only through Christ

**Application:**
Our divine potential is not metaphorical but literal. Through Christ's Atonement, we can become "partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4) and eventually become like our Heavenly Parents.

**Cross-References:**
- **1 John 3:2**: "Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is"
- **D&C 132:20**: "Then shall they be gods, because they have no end"

### Theme 6: Purpose and Intentionality

**Verses:** 26, 28-30 (dominion, provision, blessing)

**Key Concept:** Everything created has divine purpose

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
Creation was not random but purposeful:
- Earth created to test God's children
- Resources provided for our needs
- Blessings pronounced upon mankind
- All designed to enable our return to God through Christ

**Application:**
Your life is not an accident. You were created with divine purpose, in the image of God, with potential to become like Christ. Everything God creates has eternal purpose.

**Cross-References:**
- **Abraham 3:24-25**: "And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there...And we will prove them herewith"
- **Jeremiah 1:5**: "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee"

## Testimony-Building Insights

### The Pre-mortal Christ: Willing Volunteer

Abraham 4 shows that Jesus Christ's role as Savior began before the foundation of the world. His volunteer statement "Here am I, send me" (Abraham 3:27) was followed by His willing descent to "go down" and create the earth (Abraham 4:1). His sacrifice was not forced but freely given.

**Testimony:**
I testify that Jesus Christ loved us before we were born. He volunteered to create the earth knowing full well He would need to suffer and die to redeem it. His entire mission—from creation to crucifixion—is an expression of perfect love.

### The Creating Christ: Divine and Powerful

The repeated use of "the Gods" establishes Christ's divine nature. He is not a created being, a moral teacher, or even just a prophet. He is the Creator of heaven and earth, possessing all power and authority.

**Testimony:**
I testify that Jesus Christ is God. He created worlds without number. He organized the heavens and the earth. He formed man in His own image. The Creator descended to save His creation.

### The Counseling Christ: Unified with the Father

"The Gods took counsel among themselves" (Abraham 4:26) reveals perfect unity between Father and Son. They deliberate, decide, and act together in complete harmony.

**Testimony:**
I testify that the Father and the Son are perfectly one. Though distinct beings, they are unified in purpose, power, and love. Through covenant relationship with Christ, we can be unified with them.

### The Orderly Christ: God of Law and Purpose

The pattern "they ordered...and they obeyed" reveals Christ's character: He establishes divine law, and all creation obeys perfectly. Order, not chaos, characterizes His work.

**Testimony:**
I testify that Jesus Christ is a God of order. His commandments are not arbitrary but perfectly designed for our growth and happiness. His laws govern both physical and spiritual creation.

### The Illuminating Christ: Light and Life

Christ created physical light before all else (Abraham 4:3), symbolizing His role as the spiritual Light of the World. All life depends on light.

**Testimony:**
I testify that Jesus Christ is the Light and Life of the world. Without His light, we would remain in spiritual darkness. Without His life, we would remain spiritually dead. He gives light and life to all things.

### The Image-Bearing Christ: Our Divine Prototype

Man created "in the image of the Gods" (Abraham 4:27) reveals our divine potential. We are created in Christ's image with capacity to become like Him.

**Testimony:**
I testify that we are children of God, created in His image, with divine potential to become like Him. This potential is realized only through Jesus Christ's Atonement. He descended that we might ascend. He became like us that we might become like Him.

## Conclusion: The Christ-Centered Message of Abraham 4

Abraham 4 is a magnificent testament of Jesus Christ's divine nature and His central role in God's plan. While Genesis 1 simply states "God created," Abraham 4 unveils the profound reality: "the Gods" counseled together, went down, organized, and ordered all things.

**Key Christ-Centered Truths:**

1. **Christ is Divine Creator** - He is not created but Creator, possessing all power and authority
2. **Christ Volunteered** - His descent to create (and later to redeem) was willing and loving
3. **Christ Works in Unity with the Father** - Perfect harmony characterizes their work
4. **Christ Established Divine Order** - Law, obedience, and purpose govern all creation
5. **Christ is the Light of Life** - All life depends on Him, physically and spiritually
6. **Christ is Our Divine Prototype** - We are created in His image to become like Him
7. **Christ Knew the Cost** - He created the earth knowing He would need to redeem it

**The Purpose Connection:**

Abraham 3:25 states the purpose: "We will prove them herewith." Abraham 4 shows the execution: creating the earth to enable that proving. The entire creation was Christocentric—designed to make possible our mortal probation and Christ's Atonement.

**The Pattern of Condescension:**

"Let us go down" appears twice in Abraham 4 (verses 1 and 26). This pattern of descending characterizes Christ's entire mission:
- Down to create the earth
- Down to create man
- Down to be born in mortality
- Down to suffer and die
- Down below all things

Each descent enables our ascent. Christ went down that we might go up.

## Final Testimony

I testify that Abraham 4 reveals Jesus Christ as the divine Creator who willingly descended to organize the earth. The same Jehovah who said "Let there be light" is the same Jesus who declared "I am the light of the world." The same God who formed man in His image is the same Savior who became a man to redeem us.

Jesus Christ is not merely a character in the creation story—He is the Creator. He is not a passive observer of the divine plan—He is the willing volunteer who makes it possible. He is not tangential to creation—He is central to it.

Everything we see testifies of Jesus Christ because He created it all. The sun witnesses of His glory, the stars testify of His infinite power, the mountains declare His majesty, and the intricate design of all living things proclaims His wisdom. And most importantly, we ourselves—created in His image—are living testimonies that Jesus Christ loves us, knows us, and has prepared a way for us to become like Him.

As we study Abraham 4, may our eyes be opened to see Christ on every page. May we recognize His willing sacrifice, His divine power, His perfect unity with the Father, and His infinite love for each of us. And may we respond to His condescension by ascending to become more like Him, through His enabling grace and atoning sacrifice.

I testify that Jesus Christ lives. He is the Creator and Redeemer. He descended that we might ascend. He became like us that we might become like Him. He is the Light and Life of the world, and through Him we can return to our Heavenly Father and receive immortality and eternal life.

In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.
