# Christ-Centered Analysis: Abraham 5
## Come Follow Me Week 3 (January 12-18, 2026)
[[Genesis 1-2, Moses 2-3, Abraham 4-5 (Jan 12-18)]]

---

## Overview

Abraham 5 completes the creation account from Abraham's unique perspective, revealing profound insights about Jesus Christ's ongoing involvement with His creation. While Abraham 4 showed "the Gods" counseling and organizing, Abraham 5 transitions to show them "watching those things which they had ordered" and actively "calling" creation into its final form.

This chapter contains distinctive language not found in Genesis 1-2 or Moses 2-3. The repeated phrases "the Gods watched" and "the Gods called" reveal Christ's sustained, attentive relationship with all He has created. He is not a distant deity who creates and then abandons His work—He watches, calls, guides, and nurtures everything He has made.

The chapter also introduces the formation of Adam and Eve (verses 7-21), showing the Gods' intimate involvement in creating humanity, providing the Garden of Eden, establishing commandments, and creating the conditions necessary for mortality, agency, and the need for a Savior. The concluding verse about the seventh day's rest (verses 2-3) reveals the divine pattern of Sabbath and completion.

Most significantly, Abraham 5 bridges creation and mortality, showing how the Gods prepared everything necessary for the plan of salvation—including the tree of knowledge of good and evil, the commandment not to partake, and the warning of death. All of this points directly to humanity's need for Jesus Christ as Redeemer.

## 1. Direct References to Jesus Christ

### "The Gods Watched Those Things Which They Had Ordered" (Abraham 5:1-21)

**The unique phrase "the Gods watched" appears repeatedly throughout Abraham 5, emphasizing:**

**Verse 1:** "Thus we will finish the heavens and the earth, and all the hosts of them."

**Analysis:**
The phrase "we will finish" reveals:
- Christ's active participation in completing creation
- The Father and Son working together to finalize their work
- Creation as a collaborative divine effort
- The purposeful completion of all that was planned in Abraham 4

**Connection to Christ:**
Jesus Christ is not only the Creator but the Finisher. This parallels His role in our salvation:
- **Hebrews 12:2**: "Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith"
- Just as Christ finished the physical creation, He will finish our spiritual creation through His Atonement
- He who began the work will complete it (Philippians 1:6)

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Christ's role as "finisher" gives us confidence that He will complete what He has begun in us. If He finished creating the heavens and earth, He will finish the work of our salvation as we faithfully follow Him.

### "The Gods Called" - Christ's Active Naming and Defining (Throughout)

**The phrase "the Gods called" appears in verses relating to the seventh day, but the concept of naming and defining permeates the chapter:**

**Verse 2-3:** "And the Gods said among themselves: On the seventh time we will end our work, which we have counseled; and we will rest on the seventh time from all our work which we have counseled. And the Gods concluded upon the seventh time, because that on the seventh time they would rest from all their works which they (the Gods) counseled among themselves to form; and sanctified it."

**Analysis:**
This passage reveals several Christ-centered truths:
- **"We have counseled"** - repeated three times, showing the ongoing divine council
- **"We will rest"** - the Gods, including Christ, model the Sabbath pattern
- **"Sanctified it"** - the Gods set apart the seventh day as holy

**Connection to Christ:**
The seventh-day rest points to Christ in multiple ways:

1. **Christ as the True Rest:**
   - **Matthew 11:28**: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest"
   - Physical rest on the seventh day symbolizes spiritual rest in Christ
   - Christ Himself is our Sabbath rest

2. **Christ Sanctifies:**
   - The Gods "sanctified" the seventh day
   - Christ sanctifies us through His Atonement
   - **Hebrews 10:10**: "By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all"

3. **Christ Completes the Father's Work:**
   - After six creative periods, the work was finished
   - On the cross, Christ declared "It is finished" (John 19:30)
   - Both creation and redemption required Christ's completing power

**Cross-References:**
- **Exodus 20:8-11**: The Sabbath commandment based on creation
- **Hebrews 4:3-10**: Christ as our rest, greater than the seventh-day rest
- **D&C 59:9-13**: The Sabbath as a day of rest and worship

**Doctrinal Significance:**
The seventh-day rest established at creation points forward to the ultimate rest found in Jesus Christ. Physical rest from labor symbolizes spiritual rest from sin through Christ's Atonement.

### "The Gods Formed Man and Put His Spirit Into Him" (Abraham 5:7)

**"And the Gods formed man from the dust of the ground, and took his spirit (that is, the man's spirit), and put it into him; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul."**

**Analysis:**
This verse reveals the dual nature of man's creation:
- **Physical body** - "formed...from the dust of the ground"
- **Pre-existing spirit** - "took his spirit...and put it into him"
- **Living soul** - the union of body and spirit through the "breath of life"

**Connection to Christ:**
Jesus Christ is intimately involved in both aspects of our existence:

1. **Christ Created Our Spirits:**
   - We are "the spirit children of God" (Hebrews 12:9, "the Father of spirits")
   - Christ, as Creator, participated in our spiritual creation
   - Our spirits existed before mortality (Jeremiah 1:5)

2. **Christ Formed Our Bodies:**
   - "The Gods formed man" - Christ shaped Adam's physical body
   - This same Christ would later take upon Himself a physical body
   - **Ether 3:15-16**: Christ's spirit body became the pattern for His physical body

3. **Christ Gives Life:**
   - "Breathed into his nostrils the breath of life"
   - **John 20:22**: Jesus "breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost"
   - Christ is the source of both physical and spiritual life

4. **Christ Reunites Body and Spirit:**
   - Death separates body and spirit
   - Christ's resurrection reunites them permanently
   - **Alma 11:43-44**: "The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form"

**Cross-References:**
- **Genesis 2:7**: Parallel account of man's formation
- **Moses 3:7**: Additional details about spiritual creation
- **Abraham 3:22-23**: Pre-mortal spirits organized before the foundation of the world
- **1 Corinthians 15:45**: "The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [Christ] was made a quickening spirit"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Because Christ created both our spirits and bodies, He has power to redeem both. His Atonement addresses our physical death (through resurrection) and spiritual death (through forgiveness). He who formed us knows how to perfect us.

**Teaching Application:**
Help others understand that our bodies are sacred because they were formed by Christ Himself. This truth should influence how we treat our bodies and how we view the resurrection as Christ's gift of eternal embodiment.

### "The Gods Commanded the Man" (Abraham 5:12-13)

**"And the Gods commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the time that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die."**

**Analysis:**
This commandment establishes several essential elements:
- Agency (freedom to choose)
- Boundaries (the prohibited tree)
- Consequences (death)
- Warning (clear communication of the result)

**Connection to Christ:**
This commandment immediately establishes humanity's need for Jesus Christ:

1. **The Commandment Requires Agency:**
   - Meaningful choice requires both options and consequences
   - Christ defended agency in the pre-mortal council (Abraham 3:27-28)
   - Satan sought to destroy agency ("I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost")

2. **The Transgression Would Require a Savior:**
   - "Thou shalt surely die" - both physical and spiritual death
   - Only Christ could overcome both deaths
   - The commandment itself necessitated the Atonement

3. **Christ's Foreknowledge:**
   - The Gods knew Adam would transgress (2 Nephi 2:22-25)
   - Yet they gave the commandment anyway
   - This reveals the plan: Fall, Atonement, redemption, exaltation

4. **Law and Justice:**
   - The commandment established divine law
   - Justice demands consequences for breaking law
   - Christ's Atonement satisfies justice while extending mercy

**Cross-References:**
- **2 Nephi 2:15-16**: "And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that there was an opposition"
- **2 Nephi 9:6-9**: Without the Atonement, the Fall would result in permanent spiritual death
- **Alma 42:6-15**: The plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made

**Doctrinal Significance:**
The very act of giving a commandment with consequences points to Christ. Without the possibility of transgression, there would be no need for a Savior. The commandment in Eden anticipated Gethsemane and Calvary.

**Verse 13 Addition - Abraham's Commentary:**

**"Now I, Abraham, saw that it was after the Lord's time, which was after the time of Kolob; for as yet the Gods had not appointed unto Adam his reckoning."**

**Analysis:**
Abraham's inspired commentary reveals:
- Time operates differently for God than for man
- The creation "days" were divine time periods, not 24-hour days
- Adam existed in a different temporal state in Eden

**Connection to Christ:**
This temporal distinction points to Christ's role:
- Christ operates in eternal time (Psalm 90:4, "A thousand years...are but as yesterday")
- Christ would bring mortality and linear time through the Fall
- Christ transcends time yet entered time to save us
- **D&C 130:4-7**: Time measured according to different planets/spheres

### "The Gods Said: Let Us Make an Help Meet for Him" (Abraham 5:14-16)

**"And the Gods said: Let us make an help meet for the man, for it is not good that the man should be alone, therefore we will form an help meet for him. And the Gods caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam; and he slept, and they took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in the stead thereof; And of the rib which the Gods had taken from man, formed they a woman, and brought her unto the man."**

**Analysis:**
The creation of Eve reveals divine purpose and pattern:
- **"Let us make"** - another divine council moment
- **"Not good that the man should be alone"** - God's first declaration that something was "not good"
- **"Help meet"** - an equal partner, not a subordinate
- **"Deep sleep"** - Adam was unconscious during Eve's formation
- **"One of his ribs"** - Eve formed from Adam's own body

**Connection to Christ:**
The creation of Eve and Adam's "deep sleep" powerfully symbolize Christ and His church:

1. **Christ's "Deep Sleep" - His Death:**
   - Adam fell into deep sleep before Eve was created
   - Christ fell into the sleep of death before the Church could be fully established
   - From Adam's side came Eve; from Christ's side came blood and water (John 19:34)

2. **Eve as a Type of the Church:**
   - Eve was formed from Adam's body
   - The Church is the "bride of Christ" (Revelation 19:7-9)
   - **Ephesians 5:25-32**: "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it...This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church"

3. **The Divine Pattern of Marriage:**
   - Marriage established by the Gods in Eden
   - Christ will be eternally united with His church
   - Temple marriage mirrors the eternal union of Christ and the faithful

4. **Christ Creates Eternal Companionship:**
   - "Not good that the man should be alone"
   - Christ ensures we are not alone—He is always with us
   - Through Him, we have eternal family relationships

**Cross-References:**
- **Genesis 2:18-24**: Parallel account
- **Moses 3:18-24**: Additional details
- **Ephesians 5:22-33**: Marriage as symbol of Christ and the Church
- **D&C 132:19-20**: Eternal marriage covenant

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Adam's deep sleep and Eve's creation from his side is one of scripture's most beautiful types of Christ's death and the formation of His church. This teaches that:
- Christ's death was necessary to create His eternal bride (the Church)
- Marriage is sacred because it reflects Christ's relationship with His people
- Eternal families are possible because Christ died and rose again

## 2. Symbolic and Typological References to Christ

### The Pattern of "Watching" - Christ's Sustaining Care (Abraham 5:1)

**"And thus we will finish the heavens and the earth, and all the hosts of them."**

**Context:** Throughout Abraham 5, the implicit theme is the Gods watching over what they had ordered (contrasted with Abraham 4's "ordering").

**Analysis:**
The transition from "ordering" (Abraham 4) to "finishing/watching" (Abraham 5) reveals Christ's sustained involvement:
- Creation is not a one-time event but an ongoing relationship
- The Gods don't abandon their creation but watch over it
- Christ continues to observe, guide, and care for all He has made

**Connection to Christ:**
Jesus Christ is the Good Shepherd who watches over His flock:

**Christ as the Watchful Shepherd:**
- **Psalm 121:3-4**: "He that keepeth thee will not slumber. Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep"
- **John 10:14**: "I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine"
- **Hebrews 13:20-21**: "The God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep"
- **1 Peter 2:25**: "For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls"

**Symbolic Significance:**
- Physical watching over creation symbolizes spiritual watching over souls
- Christ knows the fall of every sparrow (Matthew 10:29)
- He is intimately aware of all His creation and all His children
- Nothing escapes His watchful care

**Teaching Application:**
When we look at the natural world and see how perfectly it functions—seasons changing, planets orbiting, ecosystems balancing—we see evidence that Christ continues to watch over and sustain His creation. If He watches over the sparrows and lilies (Matthew 6:26-30), how much more does He watch over us?

### The Garden of Eden - Symbol of God's Presence (Abraham 5:8-9)

**"And the Gods planted a garden, eastward in Eden, and there they put the man, whose spirit they had put into the body which they had formed. And out of the ground made the Gods to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food; the tree of life, also, in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."**

**Analysis:**
Eden represents the ideal state where God and man dwell together:
- **Planted by the Gods** - Eden was not accidental but purposefully designed
- **Eastward** - often symbolic of divine presence and glory
- **Trees pleasant to sight and good for food** - beauty and provision combined
- **Tree of life in the midst** - eternal life at the center
- **Tree of knowledge** - agency and testing available

**Connection to Christ:**
The Garden of Eden symbolizes Christ's presence and the blessings He offers:

1. **Christ as the Tree of Life:**
   - **1 Nephi 11:21-22**: Lehi's vision: the tree of life represents the love of God manifest in Christ
   - **Revelation 2:7**: "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God"
   - **Revelation 22:2**: "In the midst...was there the tree of life"
   - Partaking of Christ's Atonement gives eternal life, just as the tree of life would have

2. **Eden as Temple:**
   - Eden was where God walked with man (Genesis 3:8)
   - Temples are where we commune with God through Christ
   - Both Eden and temples represent God's presence on earth
   - Cherubim guarded Eden (Genesis 3:24); cherubim also appear in temple symbolism

3. **Paradise Lost and Regained Through Christ:**
   - Adam and Eve were cast out of Eden
   - Christ opens the way back to God's presence
   - **Luke 23:43**: "To day shalt thou be with me in paradise"
   - Through Christ's Atonement, we return to God's presence—a new Eden

**Cross-References:**
- **Revelation 21:1-4**: New heaven and new earth, God dwelling with man
- **D&C 88:17-20**: The celestial kingdom as the presence of God
- **Moses 4:28-31**: Adam and Eve cast out but taught the gospel and sacrifice

**Symbolic Significance:**
Eden represents the state from which we fell and to which Christ restores us. The garden points backward to our original glory and forward to our ultimate destiny—dwelling eternally in God's presence through Christ's Atonement.

### The Two Trees - Agency and Eternal Life Through Christ (Abraham 5:9)

**"The tree of life, also, in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."**

**Analysis:**
Two trees in Eden represent two fundamental aspects of God's plan:
- **Tree of Life** - Eternal life, freely given
- **Tree of Knowledge** - Agency, testing, and mortality

**Connection to Christ:**
Both trees point to Jesus Christ and the plan of salvation:

**1. The Tree of Life = Jesus Christ:**
- Eating from the tree of life grants immortality and eternal life
- Partaking of Christ's Atonement grants the same
- **John 6:51**: "I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever"
- The tree was in the "midst" of the garden; Christ is central to God's plan
- After the Fall, cherubim guarded the tree (Genesis 3:24); Christ guards the way to eternal life

**2. The Tree of Knowledge = Necessary Opposition:**
- This tree made the Fall possible
- The Fall made the Atonement necessary
- **2 Nephi 2:15**: Opposition is essential to God's plan
- Christ's Atonement transforms the consequences of eating from this tree (death) into opportunities for growth

**3. The Pattern of Choice:**
- Two trees = two ways
- **Matthew 7:13-14**: "Wide is the gate...that leadeth to destruction...strait is the gate...which leadeth unto life"
- Christ is the narrow way that leads to the tree of life

**Cross-References:**
- **1 Nephi 8:10-12**: Lehi partakes of the tree of life
- **1 Nephi 11:21-25**: The tree represents God's love shown through Christ
- **Alma 32:40-43**: Faith in Christ as the tree of life
- **Revelation 22:14**: "Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
The tree of life was always available in Eden, but Adam and Eve never partook of it before the Fall. This teaches that:
- Eternal life requires more than innocence—it requires the experience gained through mortality
- Christ's Atonement provides access to eternal life after we've experienced good and evil
- The Fall was a necessary step toward exaltation, making Christ's role as Redeemer essential

**Teaching Application:**
The tree of life in Eden points forward to Jesus Christ. Access to that tree was blocked by cherubim after the Fall (Genesis 3:24), but Christ reopened access through His Atonement. The way to eternal life is through Him.

### Adam and Eve - Types of Christ and Humanity (Abraham 5:14-18)

**"And the Gods said: Let us make an help meet for the man, for it is not good that the man should be alone, therefore we will form an help meet for him."**

**Analysis:**
Adam and Eve are the archetypal man and woman, representing all humanity. Their experiences in Eden establish patterns for all who come after.

**Connection to Christ:**
Adam and Eve function as types in multiple ways:

**1. Adam as a Type of Christ:**
- **Romans 5:14**: "Adam...is the figure of him that was to come" (Christ)
- **1 Corinthians 15:45-47**: "The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam [Christ] was made a quickening spirit"
- Both are called "Son of God" (Luke 3:38 for Adam; throughout scripture for Christ)
- Adam received Eve through a "deep sleep" (death); Christ received His bride (the Church) through death
- Adam named all creatures, showing dominion; Christ has "the name which is above every name" (Philippians 2:9)

**2. Eve from Adam's Side / Church from Christ's Side:**
- Eve was formed from Adam's rib while he slept
- The Church was formed from Christ's sacrifice
- **John 19:34**: "One of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water"
- Blood = the Atonement; Water = baptism/rebirth
- From Christ's wounded side flows the means of salvation

**3. "They Shall Be One Flesh" (Abraham 5:18):**
- **Verse 18**: "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh"
- This establishes marriage but also points to Christ's union with the Church
- **Ephesians 5:31-32**: After quoting Genesis 2:24, Paul says, "This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church"

**4. The Pattern of Naming:**
- **Verse 17**: "And Adam said: This was bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; now she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man"
- Adam names Eve, showing his recognition and acceptance
- Christ "calls his own sheep by name" (John 10:3)
- Christ gives us a new name (Revelation 2:17; Mosiah 5:7-12)

**Cross-References:**
- **D&C 138:38-39**: "Adam, the Ancient of Days and father of all"
- **D&C 27:11**: Michael (Adam) will gather his posterity
- **Romans 5:12-21**: Comparison between Adam and Christ
- **1 Corinthians 15:21-22**: "For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive"

**Doctrinal Significance:**
Adam's deep sleep and Eve's formation from his side is a profound type of Christ's death and the creation of His church. This teaches that:
- Christ's death was necessary to create His eternal bride (those who covenant with Him)
- Marriage is sacred because it mirrors Christ's covenant relationship with His people
- Oneness in marriage points to oneness with Christ

### The Seventh Day Rest - Symbol of Christ's Rest (Abraham 5:2-3)

**"On the seventh time we will end our work, which we have counseled; and we will rest on the seventh time from all our work which we have counseled...and sanctified it."**

**Analysis:**
The seventh-day rest establishes the Sabbath pattern:
- Six periods of creative work
- Seventh period of rest
- Sanctification of the rest period
- Completion of the work

**Connection to Christ:**
The Sabbath rest is a type and shadow of the rest found in Jesus Christ:

**1. Christ as the True Sabbath Rest:**
- **Matthew 11:28-30**: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you...and ye shall find rest unto your souls"
- **Hebrews 4:1-11**: "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his"
- Physical rest on the seventh day symbolizes spiritual rest in Christ
- We cease from our own works (self-justification) and rest in Christ's finished work

**2. Christ's "It Is Finished":**
- After six days of creation, the work was complete
- On the cross, Christ declared "It is finished" (John 19:30)
- Creation required six days; Atonement required Christ's mortal ministry
- Both were completed fully and perfectly

**3. Sabbath as Sign of Covenant:**
- **Exodus 31:13**: "It is a sign between me and you throughout your generations"
- Sabbath observance points us weekly to Christ
- The Sabbath reminds us that Christ has done the work; we rest in Him
- **D&C 59:9-14**: Sabbath as a day of rest and rejoicing

**4. The Pattern of Seven:**
- Seven represents completion and perfection in scripture
- Seven days of creation
- Seven seals, trumpets, etc. in Revelation
- Christ makes us complete and perfect through His grace

**Cross-References:**
- **Hebrews 4:3-10**: Entering into God's rest through faith in Christ
- **Colossians 2:16-17**: Sabbath was "a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ"
- **3 Nephi 18:1-11**: Sacrament instituted, observed on the Sabbath, pointing to Christ

**Symbolic Significance:**
The seventh-day rest points to the ultimate rest—entering God's presence through Christ's Atonement. Just as God rested after creating, we will rest after our mortal probation is complete, entering into Christ's rest (Moroni 7:3; D&C 84:24).

**Teaching Application:**
Every Sabbath day points us to Jesus Christ. When we rest from our labors on the Sabbath, we symbolically acknowledge that our salvation rests not in our own works but in Christ's completed Atonement. The Sabbath is a weekly reminder that Christ has finished the work of redemption.

### "Bone of My Bones, Flesh of My Flesh" - Recognition and Union (Abraham 5:17-18)

**"And Adam said: This was bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; now she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man; Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh."**

**Analysis:**
Adam's declaration upon seeing Eve reveals:
- Recognition of shared nature ("bone of my bones")
- Acknowledgment of divine purpose ("taken out of man")
- Naming and identity ("shall be called Woman")
- Pattern of covenant union ("they shall be one flesh")

**Connection to Christ:**
This passage points to Christ's relationship with His people:

**1. Christ Recognizes Us as His Own:**
- We are "bone of his bone" spiritually—made in His image
- **Hebrews 2:11**: "For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren"
- Christ claims us as His own, just as Adam claimed Eve

**2. We Are Taken From Christ:**
- Just as Eve came from Adam, we are spiritually begotten through Christ
- **Mosiah 5:7**: "Ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you"
- We derive our spiritual life from Christ

**3. Covenant Union:**
- Marriage represents covenant relationship
- We covenant to "cleave" to Christ as a spouse cleaves to their companion
- **Jeremiah 31:32**: God describes His covenant with Israel as a marriage
- **Revelation 19:7-9**: The marriage supper of the Lamb

**4. "One Flesh" = Perfect Unity:**
- Marriage creates "one flesh"
- Covenant with Christ creates spiritual unity
- **John 17:20-23**: Christ's prayer that we may be one as He and the Father are one
- **D&C 35:2**: "I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God...the same which came into the world and was rejected of the world...the same which ye shall one day see"

**Cross-References:**
- **Ephesians 5:28-32**: Husbands and wives as types of Christ and the Church
- **Isaiah 54:5**: "For thy Maker is thine husband; the Lord of hosts is his name"
- **Hosea 2:19-20**: "And I will betroth thee unto me for ever"

**Symbolic Significance:**
Adam's recognition of Eve and declaration of union symbolizes:
- Christ's recognition of us as His covenant people
- Our shared divine nature with Christ (we're created in His image)
- The covenant union we enter through baptism and temple ordinances
- The eternal marriage that Christ offers to the faithful

## 3. Doctrinal Connections to Christ's Role

### Christ as the Finisher of All Things

**Verse 1:** "And thus we will finish the heavens and the earth, and all the hosts of them."

**Doctrinal Teaching:**
Jesus Christ is both the Author and Finisher:

**1. Author and Finisher of Creation:**
- He began creation in Abraham 4:1 ("Let us go down")
- He finishes creation in Abraham 5:1 ("We will finish")
- Everything from beginning to end is Christ's work

**2. Author and Finisher of Our Faith:**
- **Hebrews 12:2**: "Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith"
- He began our spiritual creation before mortality
- He will finish it through the resurrection and judgment

**3. The Pattern of Divine Completion:**
- What Christ begins, He completes
- **Philippians 1:6**: "Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ"
- **Revelation 21:6**: "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end"

**Application to Our Lives:**
If Christ finished creating the heavens and earth, we can trust Him to finish the work He has begun in us. Our spiritual progress is not dependent solely on our strength but on His power to complete what He has started.

**Cross-References:**
- **D&C 64:31**: "But he that endureth in faith and doeth my will, the same shall overcome"
- **3 Nephi 27:16-17**: Christ finishes His Father's work

### Christ as the Divine Counselor in the Godhead

**Verse 2-3:** "And the Gods said among themselves: On the seventh time we will end our work, which we have counseled...which they (the Gods) counseled among themselves to form"

**Doctrinal Teaching:**
The repeated phrase "counseled among themselves" reveals:

**1. The Pre-mortal Council:**
- Before creation, the Gods counseled together
- Christ participated actively in planning creation
- The Father, Son, and others worked in perfect unity

**2. Christ's Voice in the Council:**
- Christ is not silent or passive
- He counsels with the Father
- His will is aligned with the Father's will

**3. The Pattern of Divine Unity:**
- **John 5:19**: "The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do"
- **John 10:30**: "I and my Father are one"
- Perfect unity characterizes the Godhead

**4. Counsel Precedes Action:**
- The Gods counseled before creating
- The Gods counseled before forming man (Abraham 4:26)
- This pattern teaches us to seek divine counsel before acting

**Application to Our Lives:**
Just as the Gods counseled together before creating, we should counsel with the Lord before making important decisions. Christ invites us to seek His counsel through prayer and the Holy Ghost.

**Cross-References:**
- **Abraham 3:22-28**: The grand council in heaven
- **D&C 76:24**: "By him, and through him, and of him"
- **Jacob 4:9**: "Counseling with the Lord"

### Christ Establishes the Sabbath Pattern

**Verse 2-3:** "On the seventh time we will end our work...and we will rest...and sanctified it"

**Doctrinal Teaching:**
Christ established the Sabbath at creation, revealing several truths:

**1. Rest Is Part of God's Plan:**
- Work and rest are both divinely ordained
- The Sabbath existed before the Fall
- Rest is not laziness but renewal

**2. Christ Sanctifies:**
- "Sanctified it" - made it holy
- Only God can sanctify
- Christ sanctifies both the day and His people
- **D&C 88:18**: "That which is governed by law is also preserved by law and perfected and sanctified by the same"

**3. The Sabbath Points to Christ:**
- Weekly reminder of our covenant relationship
- Day to remember Christ's Atonement (sacrament)
- Foretaste of entering Christ's rest eternally
- **D&C 59:9-13**: The Sabbath is a day to worship and partake of the sacrament

**4. Completion Precedes Rest:**
- The Gods rested after finishing their work
- Christ declared "It is finished" before the resurrection
- We must complete our mortal probation before entering final rest

**Application to Our Lives:**
Sabbath observance is not merely a commandment but an opportunity to:
- Remember Christ's completed Atonement
- Anticipate the rest He offers
- Renew our covenant relationship with Him
- Cease from worldly labors and focus on eternal things

**Cross-References:**
- **Exodus 20:8-11**: The Sabbath commandment
- **Mark 2:27-28**: "The sabbath was made for man...Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath"
- **Hebrews 4:9-11**: "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God"

### Christ as Creator of Body and Spirit

**Verse 7:** "And the Gods formed man from the dust of the ground, and took his spirit (that is, the man's spirit), and put it into him; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul."

**Doctrinal Teaching:**
This verse reveals Christ's comprehensive role in our existence:

**1. Christ Created Our Physical Bodies:**
- "Formed man from the dust of the ground"
- He knows our physical nature intimately
- His Atonement addresses physical death through resurrection
- **Job 10:8**: "Thine hands have made me and fashioned me"

**2. Christ Participated in Our Spiritual Creation:**
- "Took his spirit...and put it into him"
- Our spirits existed before mortality (Jeremiah 1:5)
- Christ knew us in the pre-mortal world
- **Hebrews 12:9**: "The Father of spirits"

**3. Christ Gives Life to Both:**
- "Breathed into his nostrils the breath of life"
- Physical life comes from Christ
- Spiritual life comes from Christ
- **John 1:4**: "In him was life; and the life was the light of men"

**4. Christ Will Reunite Body and Spirit:**
- Death separates body and spirit
- Resurrection reunites them permanently
- **Alma 11:43**: "The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame"

**Application to Our Lives:**
Because Christ created both our bodies and spirits, He has power to redeem both. This truth should:
- Increase reverence for our physical bodies as creations of Christ
- Give hope for resurrection—Christ knows how to restore what He created
- Remind us that both physical and spiritual well-being matter to Christ
- Testify that Christ's Atonement is comprehensive—it covers all aspects of our being

**Cross-References:**
- **1 Corinthians 6:19-20**: "Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost...ye are not your own"
- **D&C 88:15**: "The spirit and the body are the soul of man"
- **D&C 138:17**: "Their sleeping dust was to be restored unto its perfect frame"

### Christ Provides Both Agency and Consequences

**Verse 12-13:** "And the Gods commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the time that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die."

**Doctrinal Teaching:**
This commandment establishes the framework for Christ's entire mission:

**1. Christ Defended Agency:**
- The commandment allows choice
- "Freely eat" from all other trees, but not this one
- In the pre-mortal council, Christ supported the Father's plan of agency (Abraham 3:27)
- Satan sought to destroy agency (Moses 4:3)

**2. Agency Requires Opposition:**
- **2 Nephi 2:11**: "It must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things"
- Without the forbidden tree, there would be no meaningful choice
- The commandment made the Fall possible
- The Fall made the Atonement necessary

**3. Christ Established Law:**
- "Thou shalt not eat"—divine law
- Law requires consequences
- "Thou shalt surely die"—both physical and spiritual death
- Justice demands penalty for broken law

**4. Christ Would Pay the Consequences:**
- The commandment's consequence is death
- Christ would suffer death to overcome death
- He would pay the price of justice so mercy could be extended
- **Alma 42:15**: "The plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made"

**Application to Our Lives:**
The commandment in Eden teaches that:
- Agency is essential to God's plan and Christ's mission
- Commandments are not arbitrary but necessary for our growth
- Consequences are real, but Christ has overcome the ultimate consequences
- We can choose wisely because Christ has provided a way to overcome our mistakes

**Cross-References:**
- **2 Nephi 2:15-16**: "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy"
- **2 Nephi 9:6-10**: Without Christ's Atonement, we would be subject to Satan eternally
- **D&C 29:39-40**: Satan rebelled and sought to destroy agency

### Christ Creates Marriage and Eternal Families

**Verse 14-18:** The creation of Eve and institution of marriage

**Doctrinal Teaching:**
The Gods' creation of Eve and institution of marriage reveals Christ's role in eternal families:

**1. Christ Ordained Marriage:**
- "Let us make an help meet" - marriage was God's idea
- Marriage existed before the Fall
- Marriage is part of God's eternal plan
- Christ performs eternal marriages in the temple

**2. Marriage Reflects Christ's Union with His People:**
- Adam's deep sleep = Christ's death
- Eve from Adam's side = Church from Christ's sacrifice
- "One flesh" = spiritual union with Christ
- **Ephesians 5:25, 31-32**: Marriage symbolizes Christ and the Church

**3. "Not Good That Man Should Be Alone":**
- God desires our eternal companionship
- Christ came to ensure we are never truly alone
- **Matthew 28:20**: "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world"
- Through Christ, we have eternal family relationships

**4. Eternal Nature of Marriage:**
- Marriage established in Eden before death existed
- This implies marriage was intended to be eternal
- Temple sealing makes eternal marriage possible through Christ's authority
- **D&C 132:19-20**: Eternal marriage leads to exaltation

**Application to Our Lives:**
Marriage is sacred because:
- It was ordained by Christ at creation
- It symbolizes our covenant relationship with Christ
- It has eternal potential through Christ's priesthood power
- It reflects the unity of the Godhead

**Cross-References:**
- **Genesis 2:18-24**: Parallel account
- **Matthew 19:4-6**: "What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder"
- **D&C 49:15-17**: Marriage ordained of God
- **D&C 131:1-4**: Eternal marriage necessary for exaltation

## 4. How Abraham 5 Testifies of Jesus Christ and His Mission

### Christ as the Completing Power

Abraham 5 shows Christ finishing what He began in Abraham 4:
- "We will finish the heavens and the earth" (v. 1)
- This testifies that Christ completes His work
- He will likewise complete our salvation (Philippians 1:6)
- His promise: "He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it"

**Testimony:**
Jesus Christ does not leave His work unfinished. He who completed creation will complete our redemption. We can trust Him to finish what He has started in our lives.

### Christ as the Divine Counselor

The repeated phrase "which we have counseled" (v. 2-3) reveals:
- Christ's active participation in divine planning
- His unity with the Father
- The deliberate, purposeful nature of creation
- That nothing happens by chance—all is counseled and planned

**Testimony:**
Jesus Christ was not an afterthought or backup plan. Before the foundation of the world, He counseled with the Father to create the earth, knowing He would need to redeem it. His sacrifice was planned, anticipated, and willingly undertaken.

### Christ as the Sabbath Rest

The seventh-day rest (v. 2-3) points to Christ as our ultimate rest:
- Physical rest symbolizes spiritual rest in Christ
- Just as God rested after creation, we rest from our works through Christ
- The Sabbath became a weekly reminder of Christ's completed Atonement
- Entering God's rest means entering Christ's presence

**Testimony:**
Jesus Christ offers rest to our souls (Matthew 11:28-30). The Sabbath established at creation points forward to the eternal rest He provides. We cease from our own works—our futile attempts at self-justification—and rest in His finished work.

### Christ as Creator of Humanity

Abraham 5:7 shows Christ intimately involved in creating Adam:
- Forming his body from dust
- Placing his pre-existing spirit into the body
- Breathing life into him
- Making him a living soul

**Testimony:**
Jesus Christ knows us completely because He created us. He formed our bodies, He knows our spirits, and He breathed life into us. Because He created us, He knows how to perfect us and ultimately how to resurrect us.

### Christ as the Source of Agency and Redemption

The commandment regarding the tree of knowledge (v. 12-13) immediately establishes humanity's need for Christ:
- Agency requires the possibility of wrong choices
- The commandment made the Fall possible
- The Fall made Christ's Atonement necessary
- Christ knew this before creating Adam

**Testimony:**
Jesus Christ gave the commandment knowing Adam would transgress. This was not divine entrapment but divine wisdom. The Fall was foreknown, and Christ's Atonement was foreordained. The very act of creating humanity with agency testified of Christ's willingness to redeem us.

### Christ as the Foundation of Marriage and Family

The creation of Eve and institution of marriage (v. 14-18) points to Christ:
- Adam's deep sleep symbolizes Christ's death
- Eve from Adam's side symbolizes the Church from Christ's sacrifice
- "One flesh" symbolizes covenant unity with Christ
- Marriage is eternal because Christ makes it so

**Testimony:**
Jesus Christ established marriage and family relationships. He died so that we could have eternal families. The union of Adam and Eve foreshadowed the eternal union Christ offers to those who covenant with Him. Marriage is sacred because it reflects Christ's relationship with His people.

### Christ as the Watchful Shepherd

The transition from "ordering" (Abraham 4) to "finishing" and implicitly "watching" (Abraham 5) reveals:
- Christ doesn't abandon His creation
- He watches over all He has made
- He sustains, guides, and cares for His creation continuously
- Nothing escapes His watchful care

**Testimony:**
Jesus Christ is not a distant deity who created and then departed. He watches over all He has made. As the Good Shepherd, He knows His sheep, calls them by name, and watches over them continually. We are never outside His watchful care.

## 5. Key Themes That Point to Christ

### Theme 1: Completion and Perfection

**Verses:** 1, 2-3

**Key Phrases:** "We will finish," "end our work"

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
Jesus Christ is the perfecter and finisher:
- He finished creation
- He finished the Atonement ("It is finished")
- He will finish our salvation
- He is "Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end"

**Application:**
What Christ begins, He completes. If we endure faithfully, He will perfect us (Moroni 10:32-33). Our role is to trust His power to finish what He has started.

**Cross-References:**
- **Hebrews 12:2**: "Author and finisher of our faith"
- **Philippians 1:6**: "Will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ"
- **Revelation 21:6**: "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end"

**Teaching Moment:**
Ask: "What does it mean that Christ will 'finish' the work He began in us?" It means that:
- Our salvation doesn't depend solely on our perfection but on His
- He provides the grace to complete what we cannot complete alone
- Trust in Christ's power to perfect us over time

### Theme 2: Rest in Christ

**Verses:** 2-3

**Key Concept:** Seventh-day rest and sanctification

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
The Sabbath rest established at creation points to Jesus Christ:
- Physical rest symbolizes spiritual rest
- We cease from our own works and rest in His
- The Sabbath is a weekly covenant renewal pointing to Christ
- Eternal rest is found only in Christ's presence

**Application:**
Every Sabbath reminds us that Christ has done the work of salvation. We rest not because we've earned it but because He has finished it. True rest is found in surrendering our burdens to Him.

**Cross-References:**
- **Matthew 11:28-30**: "Come unto me...and I will give you rest"
- **Hebrews 4:3-10**: Entering into God's rest through faith
- **Moroni 7:3**: "The peaceable followers of Christ...have entered into the rest of the Lord"

**Teaching Moment:**
Object lesson: Show someone trying to carry heavy weights. Discuss how exhausting it is to carry our own burdens. Then show the relief when someone else (representing Christ) takes the burden. The Sabbath rest reminds us to let Christ carry our burdens.

### Theme 3: The Dual Nature of Man - Body and Spirit

**Verses:** 7

**Key Concept:** Spirit placed into body formed from dust

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
Christ created both our spirits and bodies:
- We existed as spirits before mortality (pre-mortal life)
- Christ formed our physical bodies (creation)
- Union of spirit and body makes us "living souls"
- Christ will reunite body and spirit permanently (resurrection)

**Application:**
Both our physical and spiritual natures matter to Christ. He cares about:
- Our physical health (Word of Wisdom, etc.)
- Our spiritual development (commandments, ordinances)
- Our eternal embodiment (resurrection)

Because Christ created both, He can perfect both.

**Cross-References:**
- **D&C 88:15**: "The spirit and the body are the soul of man"
- **1 Corinthians 6:19-20**: "Your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost"
- **Alma 40:23**: "The spirit and the body is restored to itself again"

**Teaching Moment:**
Explain that we are not spirits trapped in bodies (gnostic heresy) but eternal beings composed of both spirit and body. Christ values both aspects and through His Atonement redeems both from death and sin.

### Theme 4: Agency and Accountability

**Verses:** 12-13

**Key Concept:** Commandment, choice, and consequences

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
Jesus Christ established the framework that requires both agency and a Savior:
- Commandments provide boundaries
- Agency allows choice
- Consequences make choices meaningful
- Christ overcomes the ultimate consequence (death)

**Application:**
Every commandment points to Christ because:
- Commandments reveal our need for His grace
- We cannot keep them perfectly without His help
- Breaking them requires His forgiveness
- He paid the price of justice so mercy could be extended

**Cross-References:**
- **2 Nephi 2:11-16**: Opposition necessary, Messiah makes redemption possible
- **Alma 42:15**: "The plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made"
- **D&C 29:39**: Satan sought to destroy agency

**Teaching Moment:**
Ask: "Why did God give a commandment He knew would be broken?" Because:
- Without commandments and consequences, there would be no growth
- The Fall was necessary for mortality and progression
- Christ had already volunteered to redeem us from the consequences
- The commandment wasn't a trap but a necessary step in God's plan

### Theme 5: Marriage as Type of Christ and the Church

**Verses:** 14-18

**Key Concept:** Adam's deep sleep, Eve from his side, "one flesh"

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
The creation of Eve is one of scripture's most beautiful types of Christ's Atonement:
- Adam's deep sleep = Christ's death
- Eve from Adam's side = Church from Christ's side (blood and water)
- "Bone of my bones" = Christ recognizes us as His own
- "One flesh" = Covenant union with Christ

**Application:**
Marriage is sacred because:
- It was established by Christ at creation
- It symbolizes our relationship with Him
- It can be eternal through His priesthood power
- It teaches us about covenant, sacrifice, and unity

**Cross-References:**
- **Ephesians 5:25-32**: Marriage as symbol of Christ and the Church
- **John 19:34**: Blood and water from Christ's side
- **Revelation 19:7-9**: The marriage supper of the Lamb
- **D&C 132:19-20**: Eternal marriage covenant

**Teaching Moment:**
Explain the symbolism: Just as Adam had to fall into a deep sleep (death) before Eve could be created, Christ had to die before His church could be fully established. From Adam's wounded side came Eve; from Christ's wounded side came the means of salvation (blood = Atonement; water = baptism/purification).

### Theme 6: Divine Providence and Preparation

**Verses:** 8-11

**Key Concept:** The garden prepared, trees provided, man placed in perfect environment

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
Christ prepares everything necessary for our success:
- Eden was prepared before Adam was placed there
- All needs were anticipated and provided
- Beauty and function combined
- The tree of life was available (pointing to Christ)

**Application:**
Jesus Christ has prepared everything necessary for our salvation:
- The earth as a place for our mortal probation
- Prophets to teach us
- Scriptures to guide us
- The Atonement to redeem us
- Ordinances to exalt us

Nothing is left to chance. He has anticipated every need.

**Cross-References:**
- **John 14:2-3**: "I go to prepare a place for you"
- **1 Corinthians 2:9**: "Eye hath not seen...the things which God hath prepared for them that love him"
- **D&C 78:15**: "I have prepared all things"

**Teaching Moment:**
Ask: "What does Eden teach us about Christ's character?" That He:
- Provides abundantly (many trees to eat from)
- Creates beauty, not just function (trees "pleasant to the sight")
- Anticipates our needs before we ask
- Desires our joy and success

### Theme 7: The Pattern of Counsel and Unity

**Verses:** 2-3 ("which we have counseled")

**Key Concept:** The Gods counseling together before acting

**Christ-Centered Insight:**
Perfect unity characterizes the Father and the Son:
- They counsel together
- They decide together
- They act together
- They are "one" in purpose, mind, and will

**Application:**
We are invited into this divine unity:
- Through covenant, we become "one" with Christ (D&C 50:43-44)
- We should counsel with the Lord in all our doings (Alma 37:37)
- Family councils can reflect the divine pattern
- Unity with Christ brings unity with others

**Cross-References:**
- **John 17:20-23**: Christ's prayer for unity
- **3 Nephi 11:27**: "There shall be no disputations among you"
- **Moses 7:18**: Zion - "they were of one heart and one mind"

## Testimony-Building Insights

### The Finishing Christ

Abraham 5:1 declares "Thus we will finish the heavens and the earth." This testifies that Jesus Christ:
- Completes what He begins
- Does not abandon His work midway
- Will finish our salvation as surely as He finished creation
- Is both "Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end"

**Testimony:**
I testify that Jesus Christ finishes His work. Just as He completed creation, He completed the Atonement. And He will complete our salvation if we faithfully follow Him. When we feel inadequate or incomplete, we can trust in Christ the Finisher to perfect us over time.

### The Resting Christ

The seventh-day rest (verses 2-3) reveals that Jesus Christ:
- Established the Sabbath at creation as a weekly reminder
- Offers rest from the burdens of sin and mortality
- Invites us to cease from our own works and trust in His
- Will provide eternal rest in His presence

**Testimony:**
I testify that Jesus Christ is our rest. The Sabbath established at creation points to the ultimate rest found in Him. When we feel weary, overwhelmed, or burdened, He invites us to come unto Him and find rest for our souls (Matthew 11:28-30).

### The Creating Christ - Intimate and Personal

Verse 7 shows Christ forming man's body, placing his spirit, and breathing life. This testifies that Jesus Christ:
- Knows us completely—body and spirit
- Created us individually and personally
- Has power to resurrect what He created
- Cares about all aspects of our being—physical, mental, spiritual

**Testimony:**
I testify that Jesus Christ knows you personally because He created you. He formed your body with His own hands. He knows your physical strengths and weaknesses. He placed your spirit—He knows your divine identity and potential. Because He created you, He knows how to perfect you and ultimately how to resurrect you.

### The Watching Christ

The shift from Abraham 4 ("ordering") to Abraham 5 ("finishing" and implicitly "watching") reveals that Jesus Christ:
- Doesn't abandon His creation
- Watches over all He has made
- Sustains the universe continually (D&C 88:41-47)
- Knows the fall of every sparrow (Matthew 10:29)

**Testimony:**
I testify that Jesus Christ watches over you. He is not a distant deity who created and then departed. As the Good Shepherd, He knows His sheep, calls them by name, and watches over them continually. You are never outside His watchful care.

### The Counseling Christ - United with the Father

The phrase "which we have counseled" (repeated in verses 2-3) testifies that Jesus Christ:
- Works in perfect unity with the Father
- Was actively involved in planning creation
- Knew before the foundation of the world that He would need to redeem us
- Chose willingly to be our Savior

**Testimony:**
I testify that Jesus Christ's sacrifice was not an emergency backup plan. Before creating the earth, He and the Father counseled together. He knew the cost. He understood that creating humanity with agency would require a Redeemer. And He willingly volunteered because of His perfect love.

### The Providing Christ - Eden as Type

The Garden of Eden (verses 8-11) with its abundant provision testifies that Jesus Christ:
- Anticipates our needs before we ask
- Provides abundantly, not sparingly
- Creates beauty as well as function
- Desires our joy and success

**Testimony:**
I testify that Jesus Christ has prepared everything necessary for your salvation. Just as He prepared Eden before placing Adam there, He has prepared prophets, scriptures, ordinances, and above all, the Atonement, to enable your return to God. Nothing is left to chance.

### The Commanding and Liberating Christ

The commandment about the tree of knowledge (verses 12-13) testifies that Jesus Christ:
- Gives commandments to enable our growth, not restrict our joy
- Respects our agency absolutely
- Knew we would fall and prepared a way to redeem us
- Transforms consequences into opportunities for growth

**Testimony:**
I testify that Jesus Christ's commandments are expressions of love, not arbitrary restrictions. The commandment in Eden made the Fall possible, and the Fall made mortality possible, and mortality makes exaltation possible—all through Christ's Atonement. He gave agency knowing it would require His sacrifice.

### The Covenanting Christ - Marriage as Type

The creation of Eve and institution of marriage (verses 14-18) testifies that Jesus Christ:
- Established marriage as an eternal institution
- Desires our eternal companionship—we are His bride
- Entered a covenant relationship with us through His sacrifice
- Makes eternal families possible through His priesthood power

**Testimony:**
I testify that Jesus Christ established marriage at creation and died to make it eternal. The profound symbolism of Adam's deep sleep and Eve's creation from his side points to Christ's death and the formation of His church. Marriage is sacred because it reflects our covenant relationship with Christ, which is eternal.

**The Transition from Abraham 4 to Abraham 5:**

- Abraham 4: "Let us go down" and organize
- Abraham 5: "We will finish" and rest
- This pattern mirrors Christ's entire mission:
  - He descended to create
  - He descended to be born
  - He descended below all things to atone
  - He finished the work: "It is finished"
  - He provides rest to our souls

**The Pattern of Divine Love:**

Every element of Abraham 5 reveals Christ's love:
- He finishes what He starts—showing faithfulness
- He rests and invites us to rest—showing mercy
- He forms us personally—showing care
- He watches over us continually—showing devotion
- He provides abundantly—showing generosity
- He gives agency—showing respect
- He institutes marriage—showing His desire for eternal relationship

**The Purpose Connection:**

Abraham 5 completes the physical creation that Abraham 3:25 planned: "We will prove them herewith." The earth was created to test God's children, requiring:
- Agency (the two trees)
- Commandments (with consequences)
- Mortality (through the Fall)
- A Redeemer (Jesus Christ)

Everything in Abraham 5 points to the necessity and reality of Jesus Christ as Savior.

## Final Testimony

I testify that Abraham 5 reveals Jesus Christ as the faithful Finisher of all things. He finished creation and He finished the Atonement with those three powerful words: "It is finished" (John 19:30). And He will finish our salvation if we trust in Him and endure faithfully to the end.

The seventh-day rest established at creation testifies that Jesus Christ offers rest—rest from the burden of sin, rest from the weariness of self-justification, rest from anxiety and fear. He invites us: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28).

The formation of Adam from dust and spirit testifies that Jesus Christ knows us intimately—every physical weakness, every spiritual struggle. He created us, and He has power to redeem us, resurrect us, and perfect us.

The Garden of Eden testifies that Jesus Christ prepares everything necessary for our success. Just as He prepared Eden before placing Adam there, He has prepared prophets, scriptures, ordinances, and the Atonement itself to enable our return to our Heavenly Father.

The commandment regarding the tree of knowledge testifies that Jesus Christ respects our agency while providing a way to overcome the consequences of our choices. He knew we would fall, and He had already volunteered to redeem us.

The creation of Eve and institution of marriage testifies that Jesus Christ desires eternal relationships with us. The profound symbolism of Adam's deep sleep and Eve's formation from his side points to Christ's death and the creation of His church, His covenant people, His eternal bride.

Abraham 5 is the completion of the creation account, but it is also the foundation for understanding Christ's Atonement. Creation and redemption are inseparably connected. He who created the earth knew He would need to redeem it. He who formed humanity knew He would need to save it. He who gave the commandment knew we would break it and prepared a way for forgiveness.

As we study Abraham 5, may we see Jesus Christ as:
- The Finisher who completes what He begins
- The Rest-Giver who relieves our burdens
- The Creator who knows us intimately
- The Watcher who never abandons us
- The Provider who anticipates our needs
- The Covenant-Maker who desires our eternal companionship

I testify that Jesus Christ lives. He finished the work of creation. He finished the work of Atonement. And He will finish the work of our salvation. He is the Author and Finisher of our faith, and through Him we can return to our Heavenly Father's presence and receive immortality and eternal life.

May we rest in His finished work, trust in His continuing care, and look forward to the day when we will enter into His rest eternally, is my prayer in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.
