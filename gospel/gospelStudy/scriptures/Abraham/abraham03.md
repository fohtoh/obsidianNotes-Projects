## Come Follow Me Week 2 (January 5-11, 2026)

---

## Overview

Abraham 3 is one of the most profound revelations in scripture about the pre-mortal existence and the Grand Council in Heaven. While Jesus Christ is not explicitly named in this chapter, it contains the most direct scriptural account of His foreordained role as our Savior and His acceptance of the Father's plan. This chapter testifies powerfully of Christ's willing submission, divine intelligence, and central role in our eternal progression.

## 1. Direct References to Jesus Christ

### The One "Like Unto the Son of Man" (Verse 27)

**Primary Reference:**
> "And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me." (Abraham 3:27)

**Analysis:**
This is the clearest scriptural account of Christ's acceptance of His mission as Savior. The phrase "like unto the Son of Man" is significant:

- **The title "Son of Man"** is one of Christ's most frequently used self-designations in the New Testament, appearing over 80 times
- **Pre-mortal Christ** is here identified by a mortal title, showing His foreordination to take upon Himself mortality
- **"Here am I, send me"** demonstrates His willing submission and voluntary acceptance of the Atonement

**Cross-References:**
- **Moses 4:2** provides additional detail: "And I, the Lord God, spake unto Moses, saying: That Satan, whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is the same which was from the beginning, and he came before me, saying—Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor."
- **Isaiah 6:8** echoes this pattern: "Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me."
- **D&C 93:21** confirms: "And now, verily I say unto you, I was in the beginning with the Father, and am the Firstborn"

**Theological Significance:**
This verse reveals Christ's character as one of perfect obedience, humility, and love. Unlike Lucifer's "send me" which came with conditions and demanded glory, Christ's response demonstrated:
- Submission to the Father's will
- Recognition of agency as central to the plan
- Willingness to suffer for all mankind
- Complete trust in the Father's wisdom

---

### "The First" (Verse 27)

**Reference:**
> "And the Lord said: I will send the first." (Abraham 3:27)

**Analysis:**
The Father's declaration "I will send the first" carries multiple profound meanings:

- **Firstborn in the spirit**: Christ was the firstborn of all the Father's spirit children (D&C 93:21; Colossians 1:15)
- **First in faithfulness**: The first to accept and champion the Father's plan
- **First in sacrifice**: The first to covenant to give His all for others
- **Preeminent**: "First" denotes supremacy and preeminence (Colossians 1:18: "that in all things he might have the preeminence")

**Cross-References:**
- **Colossians 1:15-18**: "Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature... And he is before all things, and by him all things consist... that in all things he might have the preeminence"
- **Revelation 1:5**: "Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth"
- **Hebrews 1:6**: "And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him"

## 2. Symbolic and Typological References to Christ

### Kolob: A Type of Christ (Verses 2-3, 9, 16)

**References:**
> "And I saw the stars, that they were very great, and that one of them was nearest unto the throne of God... And the Lord said unto me: These are the governing ones; and the name of the great one is Kolob, because it is near unto me, for I am the Lord thy God" (Abraham 3:2-3)

**Symbolic Connection to Christ:**

While Kolob literally represents a great star or planet, it serves as a powerful type and symbol of Jesus Christ:

**Parallels:**
1. **Nearest to God's throne**: Just as Kolob is "nearest unto the throne of God," Christ sits at the right hand of the Father (Mark 16:19; Hebrews 1:3)

2. **The governing one**: Kolob is described as governing "all those which belong to the same order" - Christ is the King of kings, governing all creation (Revelation 19:16)

3. **The greatest**: "Kolob is the greatest of all the Kokaubeam" (v. 16) - Christ is supreme above all (Colossians 1:18)

4. **After the manner of the Lord**: "Kolob was after the manner of the Lord" (v. 4) - Christ is "the express image of his person" (Hebrews 1:3)

5. **Source of light**: Stars give light - Christ is "the light and the life of the world" (3 Nephi 11:11; D&C 10:70)

**Cross-References:**
- **John 1:9**: "That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world"
- **D&C 88:6-13**: Christ is "the light of the sun, and the power thereof by which it was made... the light of the moon... the light of the stars"
- **Revelation 22:16**: "I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star"

### The Order of Intelligence: Christ as the Most Intelligent (Verses 18-19, 21)

**References:**
> "And the Lord said unto me: These two facts do exist, that there are two spirits, one being more intelligent than the other; there shall be another more intelligent than they; I am the Lord thy God, I am more intelligent than they all." (Abraham 3:19)

> "I came down in the beginning in the midst of all the intelligences thou hast seen." (Abraham 3:21)

**Connection to Christ:**

These verses establish a hierarchy of intelligence with God at the apex. Christ's position in this order is clarified through additional scripture:

**Christ's Intelligence:**
1. **In the beginning with the Father** (John 1:1-2): "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God"

2. **Grace for grace** (D&C 93:11-13): Christ "received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace; And he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness"

3. **Creator through intelligence**: "All things were made by him" (John 1:3) - Christ's intelligence was sufficient to organize all creation under the Father's direction

**Theological Significance:**
- Intelligence is eternal (v. 18) - Christ's intelligence and glory existed before His mortal birth
- Progression is eternal - even Christ "received grace for grace" showing pattern of eternal progression
- Christ's superior intelligence qualified Him uniquely for the role of Savior

**Cross-References:**
- **D&C 93:36**: "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth"
- **1 Corinthians 1:24**: Christ is "the power of God, and the wisdom of God"
- **Colossians 2:3**: In Christ "are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge"

## 3. Doctrinal Connections to Christ's Pre-Mortal Role

### The Noble and Great Ones (Verses 22-23)

**References:**
> "Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones; And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers" (Abraham 3:22-23)

**Christ's Role:**

While Abraham is told "thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born," Christ stands as the supreme example of the "noble and great":

1. **Chief among the noble**: Christ is the "Chief Cornerstone" (Ephesians 2:20), the greatest of all the noble and great ones

2. **Foreordained as Savior**: Just as Abraham was foreordained to his mission, Christ was foreordained from before the foundation of the world (1 Peter 1:19-20: "a lamb without blemish and without spot: Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world")

3. **Leader and exemplar**: Christ leads the noble and great in their missions - He is both the ultimate example and the one who empowers them

**Cross-References:**
- **Jeremiah 1:5**: "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations"
- **Ephesians 1:4**: "According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world"
- **Alma 13:3**: Priests were "called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works"

---

### The Plan of Salvation (Verses 24-26)

**References:**
> "And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them" (Abraham 3:24-25)

**Christ's Central Role:**

The phrase "one among them that was like unto God" refers to Christ, who:

1. **Presented the plan**: Though the plan was the Father's, Christ was the spokesman and advocate
2. **Inclusive language**: "We will go down... we will make an earth" - Christ worked in perfect unity with the Father (as Jehovah, the Creator under the Father's direction)
3. **The test keeper**: The plan to "prove them herewith" required a Redeemer who could satisfy justice while offering mercy

**The Second Estate and Christ:**

Verse 26 explains the estates:
> "And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever."

**Christ's keeping of the estates:**
- **First estate**: Christ kept His first estate perfectly, never wavering in the pre-mortal world
- **Second estate**: Christ is the only one who kept His second estate perfectly without sin (Hebrews 4:15)
- **Glory added**: Christ received "all power in heaven and in earth" (Matthew 28:18) and received the fulness of the Father's glory (D&C 93:16-17)

**Cross-References:**
- **Moses 1:33**: "And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten"
- **John 17:5**: "And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was"
- **D&C 76:24**: "That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God"

### The Contrast with Lucifer (Verse 28)

**Reference:**
> "And the second was angry, and kept not his first estate; and, at that day, many followed after him." (Abraham 3:28)

**Christ Illuminated Through Contrast:**

The mention of "the second" (Lucifer/Satan) who "was angry" powerfully highlights Christ's character by contrast:

| **Christ ("the first")** | **Lucifer ("the second")** |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Humble submission | Prideful rebellion |
| "Here am I, send me" | "Send me... give me thine honor" (Moses 4:1) |
| Preserves agency | "I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost" - destroying agency (Moses 4:1) |
| Gives glory to Father | Seeks Father's honor for himself |
| Kept first estate | "Kept not his first estate" |
| Meek and patient | Angry |
| Gathers Israel | Scatters souls |
| Brings exaltation | Brings misery |

**Theological Significance:**
This contrast demonstrates that:
- Christ's plan centered on agency, growth, and genuine exaltation
- Christ was willing to descend below all things to lift us up
- Christ's character of humility qualified Him for Godhood
- The presence of opposition (Lucifer's plan) helps us appreciate the beauty and wisdom of Christ's plan

**Cross-References:**
- **Moses 4:1-4**: Full account of Lucifer's rebellion
- **Isaiah 14:12-15**: "How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer... For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God"
- **2 Nephi 2:11-13**: "For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things"
- **D&C 29:36-37**: Satan "rebelled against me, saying, Give me thine honor, which is my power"

## 4. How Abraham 3 Testifies of Jesus Christ and His Mission

### 1. Testifies of His Foreordination

Abraham 3 reveals that nothing about Christ's mission was accidental or improvised. He was chosen, prepared, and foreordained from the beginning. This testifies of:
- The Father's perfect plan centered on His Son
- Christ's willing acceptance of His role before the world began
- The eternal nature of the Atonement (not a Plan B, but the plan from the beginning)

### 2. Testifies of His Voluntary Sacrifice

The phrase "Here am I, send me" captures the essence of Christ's voluntary nature. No one forced Him; no one compelled Him. He chose freely to:
- Take upon Himself our sins
- Suffer beyond comprehension
- Die that we might live
- Descend below all things that He might lift us up

**Cross-Reference:**
- **John 10:17-18**: "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself"

### 3. Testifies of His Perfect Unity with the Father

The collaborative language ("We will go down... we will make an earth") demonstrates perfect unity between Father and Son. They are:
- One in purpose
- One in love for us
- One in Their desire for our exaltation
- Working together in perfect harmony

**Cross-Reference:**
- **John 17:21-22**: "That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee"
- **3 Nephi 11:27**: "The Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one"

### 4. Testifies of His Superior Intelligence and Worthiness

Christ's selection as "the first" was not arbitrary. His intelligence, faithfulness, and character qualified Him uniquely for His role. This teaches us:
- Preparation matters
- Intelligence and faithfulness are developed over time
- We can grow in grace as Christ did
- Our Savior is supremely qualified to save us

### 5. Testifies of the Eternal Nature of His Mission

The doctrine that "spirits... have no beginning; they existed before, they shall have no end" (v. 18) testifies that:
- Christ existed before His mortal birth
- His mission spans eternity (Alpha and Omega)
- The Atonement has retroactive power (saving those who lived before Christ)
- Our relationship with Him is eternal, not temporary

## 5. Key Christ-Centered Themes for Personal and Family Study

### Theme 1: Agency - Christ's Gift to Us

**Key Insight:** Christ's plan preserved our agency, while Lucifer's would have destroyed it. Every time we make a righteous choice, we honor Christ's sacrifice to preserve our freedom.

**Discussion Questions:**
- How does Christ's willingness to allow us to choose (even to fail) show His love?
- Why was preserving agency worth the terrible cost of the Atonement?
- How can we use our agency to honor Christ's sacrifice?

**Application:** Help family members recognize that when we choose to follow Christ, we're choosing the same path He advocated in the pre-mortal world.

---

### Theme 2: "Here Am I, Send Me" - Following Christ's Example

**Key Insight:** Christ's immediate, willing response to the Father's call is our pattern for discipleship.

**Discussion Questions:**
- What does it mean to say "Here am I" to the Lord today?
- What callings or opportunities is the Lord giving us to serve?
- How can we develop Christ's willingness to sacrifice for others?

**Key Insight:** Intelligence is eternal, and we can grow in intelligence and light as Christ did, "from grace to grace."

**Discussion Questions:**
- How does knowing that intelligence is eternal change how we view learning and education?
- What kinds of intelligence matter most? (spiritual, moral, intellectual)
- How did Christ increase in "wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man"? (Luke 2:52)

**Application:** Set family goals for spiritual learning - scripture study, temple attendance, service that develops Christlike attributes.

---

### Theme 4: Foreordination - We Were Chosen Before We Were Born

**Key Insight:** Like Abraham, we were among the "noble and great ones" who chose to follow Christ in the pre-mortal world. We have missions to fulfill.

**Discussion Questions:**
- What does it mean that we were "chosen before [we were] born"?
- How does understanding our pre-mortal faithfulness help us face challenges now?

### Theme 6: The War in Heaven Continues

**Key Insight:** The conflict between Christ's plan and Lucifer's rebellion continues today. We're still choosing which side we're on.

**Discussion Questions:**
- How does Satan's plan still tempt us today? (shortcuts to happiness, avoiding consequences, seeking honor without worthiness)
- What are modern examples of Lucifer's anger when people choose Christ?

**Discussion Questions:**
- How does knowing Christ created the earth change how we view nature?
- What does creation teach us about Christ's character?

## 6. Teaching Applications

### For Personal Study:

1. **Meditation on Christ's "Here am I, send me"**: Spend time contemplating what it cost Christ to say those words. What did He know He was accepting? How does His willingness affect your faith in Him?

2. **Journal Prompting**: "What does it mean to me that I was among the 'noble and great ones' who supported Christ in the pre-mortal world? How does that knowledge strengthen me today?"

3. **Comparison Study**: Read Abraham 3:27 alongside Moses 4:1-4 and D&C 29:36-39. Create a chart comparing Christ's plan with Lucifer's rebellion.

4. **Topical Study**: Trace the theme of Christ as Creator through Abraham 3, Genesis 1, John 1, Moses 1-2, and D&C 76. How does this role as Creator relate to His role as Redeemer?

### For Family Study:

1. **Visual Aid**: Use Kolob and the stars as a visual representation of degrees of glory and eternal progression. Discuss how Christ is the "greatest" light.

2. **Role Play**: Have family members act out the Grand Council scene (verses 24-28). Help children understand the two plans and why Christ's plan was chosen.

3. **"Here Am I" Activity**: Each family member identifies one way they can say "Here am I, send me" this week. Follow up at next family home evening.

4. **Intelligence Discussion**: Discuss verse 19 and what it means that we are eternal beings who can grow in intelligence forever. How does this affect our approach to learning?

### For Teaching in Church:

1. **Testimony Focus**: Begin and end with testimony of Christ's willing sacrifice in accepting the Father's call.

2. **Avoid Speculation**: While Abraham 3 invites profound thought, avoid speculating about:
   - The exact nature of pre-mortal life beyond what's revealed
   - The identities of specific "noble and great ones" (other than those identified in scripture)
   - Scientific theories about Kolob's location or astronomical details

3. **Application Emphasis**: Move from ancient councils to present choices. How are we still choosing Christ's plan today?

4. **Use Modern Prophets**: Incorporate teachings from recent General Conference about:
   - Our divine identity and potential
   - The importance of agency
   - Christ's atoning mission
   - Eternal families
