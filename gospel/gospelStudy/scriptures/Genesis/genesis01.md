# Christ-Centered Analysis: Genesis 1
## "In the Beginning": Jesus Christ as Creator and Light

---

## Overview of Genesis 1

Genesis 1 is the majestic account of the Creation of heaven and earth. While the King James Version uses the generic term "God" (Hebrew: Elohim), the Joseph Smith Translation and modern revelation clarify that **Jesus Christ, under the direction of God the Father, was the actual Creator of all things**. This chapter is fundamentally a testimony of Jesus Christ's divine power, His role in the Father's plan, and His identity as the source of light and life.

## 1. Direct References to Jesus Christ

The Joseph Smith Translation (Moses 2 in the Pearl of Great Price) provides explicit, direct references to Jesus Christ that are not found in the King James Version:

### A. Christ Identified as the Only Begotten Creator (JST Genesis 1:2, 5)

**"I am the Beginning and the End, the Almighty God. By mine Only Begotten I created these things."** (JST Genesis 1:2/Moses 2:1)

**Significance:** This is the most explicit reference to Christ in Genesis 1. God the Father declares that He created all things **"by mine Only Begotten"**—identifying Jesus Christ as the agent of Creation. This reveals:
- Christ's preeminent role before the world was formed
- His divine power and authority to create
- His identity as the Father's chosen instrument

**Supporting cross-references:**
- **D&C 93:9-10** - "The world was made by him, and in him was the life of men and the light of men. The worlds were made by him; men were made by him; all things were made by him, and through him, and of him."
- **John 1:1-3** (JST) - "In the beginning was the Word, even the Son...All things were made by him; and without him was not anything made which was made."
- **Mosiah 4:2** - "Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things"

### B. Man Created in the Image of the Only Begotten (JST Genesis 1:27, 29)

**"And I, God, said unto mine Only Begotten, which was with me from the beginning, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness"** (JST Genesis 1:27/Moses 2:26)

**"And I, God, created man in mine own image, in the image of mine Only Begotten created I him; male and female created I them."** (JST Genesis 1:29/Moses 2:27)

**Significance:** These verses reveal that:
- Jesus Christ was **actively present and participating** in the Creation ("with me from the beginning")
- The Father and Son worked together in divine council ("Let us make man")
- Humanity was created in the image of both the Father and the Only Begotten Son
- This foreshadows Christ's future condescension to take upon Himself a mortal body like ours

**Supporting cross-references:**
- **Colossians 1:15** - "Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature"
- **3 Nephi 9:15** - "Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the beginning."

## 2. Symbolic and Typological References to Christ

Beyond the direct statements in the JST, Genesis 1 contains rich symbolic testimony of Jesus Christ:

### A. "Let There Be Light" - Christ as the Light of the World (Genesis 1:3-5)

**"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness."** (Genesis 1:3-4)

**Symbolic meaning:** The very first creative act—bringing light out of darkness—is a profound type and shadow of Jesus Christ's mission. Light appears **by the word of God's power**, just as Christ is the Word made flesh.

**Christ testified:**
- **John 8:12** - "I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
- **D&C 93:2** - "I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world"

**Theological significance:**
- Just as physical light was the first creation, Christ is the "firstborn" and "beginning of the creation of God"
- Light dispels darkness—Christ dispels spiritual darkness through His gospel
- Light is essential for life—Christ is the source of eternal life
- Light reveals truth—Christ is "the way, the truth, and the life"

### B. The Pattern of Seven Days - The Completeness of Christ's Work

The Creation occurred in **six days followed by a day of rest**, establishing the pattern of the Sabbath. This points to Christ:

**Symbolic meaning:**
- The seventh day of rest foreshadows the Savior's finished work: "It is finished" (John 19:30)
- Just as Creation was "very good" and complete, Christ's Atonement is complete and perfect
- The Sabbath rest points to the rest from sin that comes through Christ (Hebrews 4:9-10)
- All things were "made very good" through Christ, who brings all things to their perfect state

### C. The Spoken Word - Christ as the Word

Throughout Genesis 1, creation occurs through **God's spoken word**: "And God said...and it was so."

**Symbolic meaning:**
- This pattern appears 10 times in Genesis 1, showing the power of God's word
- Christ is identified as "the Word" (John 1:1, D&C 93:8)
- Just as God spoke and worlds came into being, Christ speaks and souls are born again
- The creative power of the word testifies of Christ's divine power

**Supporting doctrine:**
- **D&C 93:8-9** - "Therefore, in the beginning the Word was, for he was the Word, even the messenger of salvation—The light and the Redeemer of the world"
- **Hebrews 1:2-3** - God "hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son...by whom also he made the worlds"

### D. Order from Chaos - Christ as Redeemer and Organizer

**"And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep."** (Genesis 1:2)

**Symbolic meaning:**
- Christ brought **order from chaos** in the Creation, just as He brings order to our fallen, chaotic lives
- He organized pre-existing matter, demonstrating His power to transform and redeem what is "without form and void"
- The Spirit moving upon the waters symbolizes the Holy Ghost working through Christ's power
- This mirrors Christ's power to make "all things new" (Revelation 21:5)

### E. Progressive Creation - Christ's Pattern of Line Upon Line

The Creation proceeded **progressively**: light, firmament, dry land, plants, celestial bodies, animals, mankind. This pattern teaches:

**Symbolic meaning:**
- Christ teaches and saves us "line upon line, precept upon precept" (2 Nephi 28:30)
- Just as Creation built from simple to complex, Christ leads us from faith to faith, grace to grace
- Each day was pronounced "good" before moving to the next—Christ perfects each step of our progression
- The culmination was mankind—showing God's ultimate purpose was to create His children in His image

## 3. Doctrinal Connections to Christ's Role in the Creation

### A. Christ as the Agent of Creation

**Doctrine:** Under the Father's direction, Jesus Christ was the actual Creator of this earth and all things upon it.

**Scriptural foundation:**
- **Moses 2:1** (JST Genesis 1:2) - "By mine Only Begotten I created these things"
- **D&C 76:24** - "That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created"
- **Mosiah 3:8** - "The Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity"

**Application:** Understanding Christ as Creator helps us recognize:
- His infinite power and divine nature
- His intimate knowledge of our physical bodies and mortal experience
- His authority over all creation, including power over life and death
- The profound condescension of the Creator taking mortal form

### B. The Godhead Working Together in Creation

**Doctrine:** The Creation demonstrates the unified work of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

**Evidence from Genesis 1:**
- The Father directs ("I, God, said unto mine Only Begotten")
- The Son creates ("By mine Only Begotten I created these things")
- The Spirit acts ("And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters")

**Supporting scriptures:**
- **Abraham 4:1** - "And then the Lord said: Let us go down. And they went down at the beginning"
- **Abraham 5:4** - "And the Gods came down and formed man in their own image"

**Application:** This teaches:
- The perfect unity and cooperation within the Godhead
- Each member of the Godhead has distinct roles but one purpose
- Christ's willing submission to the Father's plan, even before mortality

### C. The Pre-mortal Christ

**Doctrine:** Genesis 1 (especially the JST) provides clear evidence that Christ existed and actively participated in the pre-mortal council and Creation.

**Evidence:**
- "Mine Only Begotten, which was with me from the beginning" (Moses 2:26)
- Christ states: "I was with the Father from the beginning" (3 Nephi 9:15)
- He was "in the beginning with God" (D&C 93:21)

**Application:**
- Christ has always existed as a divine being
- He knew us before the world was formed
- He volunteered to be our Savior before Creation
- His love for us predates our mortal existence

### D. Creation and Atonement Connected

**Doctrine:** Christ's power to create and His power to redeem are inseparably connected.

**Theological insight:**
- **Revelation 13:8** - Christ is "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world"
- The same power that organized worlds enables Him to reorganize fallen souls
- He who created our bodies has power to resurrect them
- He who gave us physical life gives us spiritual and eternal life

**D&C 88:7-13** teaches that the Light of Christ:
- Gives life to all things
- Is the light of the sun, moon, and stars
- Proceeds from God through Christ
- Fills the immensity of space

**Application:**
- The Creator knows every detail of His creation—He knows us perfectly
- His creative power qualifies Him as Redeemer
- What He created "very good" (Genesis 1:31), He will restore to perfection

## 4. How Genesis 1 Testifies of Jesus Christ and His Mission

### A. Christ's Divine Nature and Authority

Genesis 1 testifies that Jesus Christ:
- Possesses **creative power** equal with God the Father
- Existed **before the foundation of the world** as a divine being
- Has **authority over all creation**—heaven, earth, and all living things
- Is the source of **light and life** to all things

**Teaching application:** When we teach Genesis 1 with Christ at the center, we help people understand that Jesus is not merely a good teacher or prophet—He is the divine Creator of the universe, possessing all power in heaven and earth.

### B. Christ's Condescension and Love

The Creator taking mortal form represents the ultimate condescension:
- The One who created all things subjected Himself to the limitations of mortality
- He who organized matter took upon Himself a physical body
- The Lord of heaven and earth was born in a manger
- The Lawgiver submitted to all law, including death

**Teaching application:** Genesis 1 magnifies the miracle of the Incarnation. The baby in Bethlehem was the same Being who spoke worlds into existence.

### C. Christ's Pattern for Bringing Order from Chaos

Genesis 1 shows Christ's pattern for redemption:
- **Assessment:** He sees our fallen, chaotic state ("without form and void")
- **Presence:** His Spirit moves upon us (v. 2)
- **Power:** He speaks and change occurs ("And God said...and it was so")
- **Progression:** He leads us step by step to perfection
- **Completion:** His work brings us to our full potential ("very good")

**Teaching application:** Just as Christ brought order to chaos in Creation, He brings order to the chaos of sin, suffering, and spiritual darkness in our lives.

### D. Christ as the Source of All Good Things

**"And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good."** (Genesis 1:31)

This verse testifies:
- All good things come from Christ, the Creator
- Christ's creations are perfect and have divine purpose
- Our physical bodies are "very good"—created by Christ with intentional design
- The earth itself testifies of Christ's power and glory

**Supporting doctrine:**
- **James 1:17** - "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above"
- **Moroni 7:12-13** - "Whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do good is of Christ"

## 6. Teaching Applications and Testimony-Building Insights

### For Gospel Teachers:

**When teaching Genesis 1, help students discover:**

1. **Start with the JST:** Always compare Genesis 1 with Moses 2 to reveal Christ explicitly. The JST is a tremendous gift that clarifies Christ's role.

2. **Use the "Christ Connection" pattern:**
   - Read the KJV verse
   - Ask: "How might this point to Christ?"
   - Read the corresponding JST verse
   - Share modern revelation (D&C 93, John 1, etc.)
   - Testify of Christ's power and love

3. **Focus on these key teaching moments:**
   - Verse 1: "In the beginning" = Christ was there before all things
   - Verse 3: Light = Christ is the Light of the World
   - Verse 26: "Let us make man" = Pre-mortal Christ counseling with the Father
   - Verse 27: Created in God's image = Created in Christ's image
   - Verse 31: "Very good" = Christ's perfect works

4. **Ask testimony-building questions:**
   - "How does knowing Christ created you affect your self-worth?"
   - "What does it mean that the Creator became mortal for you?"
   - "How does Christ bring order to the chaos in your life?"
   - "What does it mean to be created in Christ's image?"

### For Personal Study:

1. **Prayerfully ponder:** Read Genesis 1 side-by-side with Moses 2, highlighting every reference to the "Only Begotten." Ask the Holy Ghost to reveal Christ to you.

2. **Cross-reference study:** For each verse in Genesis 1, find at least one scripture from the Book of Mormon, D&C, or New Testament that connects to Christ.

3. **Journal prompts:**
   - "What does it mean to me that Christ personally created me?"
   - "How have I seen Christ bring 'light' into my spiritual darkness?"
   - "What 'chaos' in my life needs Christ's organizing power?"

4. **Create Christ-centered connections:** As you read about each day of Creation, connect it to Christ's attributes:
   - Day 1 (Light): Christ's truth dispelling darkness
   - Day 2 (Division): Christ separating us from sin
   - Day 3 (Life): Christ as the source of life
   - Day 4 (Order): Christ establishing divine order
   - Day 5 (Abundance): Christ's abundant grace
   - Day 6 (Image of God): Christ's divine nature in us

## 7. Conclusion and Testimony

Genesis 1 is far more than an ancient account of physical creation—it is a powerful testimony of Jesus Christ. When illuminated by the Joseph Smith Translation and modern revelation, we see that:

**Jesus Christ is:**
- The Only Begotten of the Father, chosen before the world was formed
- The Creator of heaven and earth, acting under the Father's direction
- The Light of the World, who first spoke light into existence
- The Word of God, by whose power all things came into being
- The source of life, light, order, and goodness
- The One in whose image we are created

**The Creation testifies that:**
- Christ's power is infinite—He spoke and worlds were formed
- Christ's love is eternal—He knew us before Creation and created us with purpose
- Christ's mission was foreordained—the Lamb was "slain from the foundation of the world"
- Christ's work is perfect—all He creates is "very good"

**Practical application:**
Understanding Christ as Creator should transform how we:
- **View ourselves:** We are creations of infinite worth, made in His divine image
- **View the earth:** This is Christ's handiwork, to be reverenced and cared for
- **View our bodies:** These temples were created by Christ with sacred purpose
- **View our trials:** The One who brought order from chaos can order our lives
- **View our potential:** He who created us in His image can transform us into His likeness

**Personal testimony:** I testify that Jesus Christ is the Creator of heaven and earth. He is the source of all light, life, and truth. The same power that organized worlds qualifies Him as our Redeemer. He who created our bodies has power to resurrect them. He who gave us mortal life offers us eternal life. Through the Joseph Smith Translation and modern revelation, we know with certainty that "by mine Only Begotten I created these things"—and that Only Begotten is Jesus Christ, our Savior and Lord.

May we read Genesis 1 with new eyes, seeing not just the creation of the world, but the testimony of the Creator Himself, who loved us enough to make this earth for us, and who loved us enough to come to this earth for us.
