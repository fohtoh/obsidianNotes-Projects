# Christ-Centered Analysis: Genesis 2
## The Garden of Eden: Jesus Christ as the Source of Life, Marriage, and Rest

---

## Overview of Genesis 2

Genesis 2 provides an intimate, detailed account of the creation of Adam and Eve and the establishment of the Garden of Eden. While the King James Version uses "LORD God" (Hebrew: Jehovah Elohim), the Joseph Smith Translation (Moses 3) reveals with stunning clarity that **Jesus Christ, under the Father's direction, was the personal Creator who formed Adam, planted the Garden, established marriage, and gave the first commandments**. This chapter is fundamentally a testimony of Christ's intimate involvement in preparing for humanity's mortal experience and His role as the source of physical and spiritual life.

Genesis 2 transitions from the cosmic scope of Creation in chapter 1 to the personal and particular—showing Christ's tender care in preparing a paradise for His children, forming them with His own hands, and establishing sacred ordinances that point to eternal life.

## 1. Direct References to Jesus Christ

The Joseph Smith Translation (Moses 3) provides explicit, direct references to Jesus Christ as the Creator:

### A. "I, the Lord God" - Christ's Personal Testimony Throughout the Chapter

Throughout Moses 3, the phrase **"I, the Lord God"** appears repeatedly, establishing Christ's personal voice and active participation. Key examples:

**"And I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life"** (Moses 3:7)

**"And I, the Lord God, planted a garden eastward in Eden"** (Moses 3:8)

**"And I, the Lord God, took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden"** (Moses 3:15)

**Significance:** These first-person declarations establish that Christ personally:
- Formed Adam's physical body with His own creative power
- Planted and prepared the Garden of Eden
- Placed Adam in paradise
- Gave the first commandments to humanity
- Created Eve and established marriage

This is not distant, impersonal creation—Christ speaks in the first person, claiming direct responsibility and intimate involvement.

### B. The Father and Son Counseling Together: "Mine Only Begotten" (Moses 3:18)

**"And I, the Lord God, said unto mine Only Begotten, that it was not good that the man should be alone; wherefore, I will make an help meet for him."** (Moses 3:18)

**Significance:** This extraordinary verse reveals:
- **The Godhead in council:** God the Father speaks to His Only Begotten Son about the creation of Eve
- **Pre-mortal Christ participating:** Christ was present and counseled with the Father about the creation of woman
- **Divine concern for humanity:** The Godhead's tender concern that "it is not good that the man should be alone"
- **Marriage ordained by Christ:** The institution of marriage was established in heaven before Eve was created on earth

**Supporting cross-references:**
- **Moses 2:26** - "And I, God, said unto mine Only Begotten, which was with me from the beginning, Let us make man in our image"
- **Abraham 4:27** - "So the Gods went down to organize man in their own image"
- **D&C 49:16-17** - "Wherefore, it is lawful that he should have one wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation"

### C. Christ as "LORD God" (Jehovah)

The term **"LORD God"** (all capitals for LORD) in the King James Version indicates the divine name **Jehovah**, which is Jesus Christ's title.

**Doctrinal clarification:**
- **Jehovah = Jesus Christ:** Modern revelation confirms that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus Christ in His pre-mortal role
- **D&C 110:3-4** - Christ appears to Joseph Smith declaring "I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain"
- **3 Nephi 15:5** - Christ declares, "Behold, I am he that gave the law, and I am he who covenanted with my people Israel"

**Significance:** Every time Genesis 2 says "LORD God," it is testifying of Jesus Christ. He is:
- The One who ended His work and rested (v. 2)
- The One who blessed and sanctified the seventh day (v. 3)
- The One who formed man from dust (v. 7)
- The One who breathed life into Adam (v. 7)
- The One who planted the Garden (v. 8)
- The One who gave commandments (vv. 16-17)
- The One who created Eve (vv. 21-22)

### D. Spiritual Creation Before Physical: Christ's Eternal Perspective (Moses 3:5)

**"For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth."** (Moses 3:5)

**"For I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men; and not yet a man to till the ground; for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth"** (Moses 3:5)

**Significance:** This profound JST addition reveals:
- **Christ created us spiritually first:** We existed as spirit children before our physical creation
- **We knew Christ in the pre-mortal life:** He created us and knew us before the world was formed
- **Physical creation follows spiritual pattern:** Christ's work follows an eternal, organized plan
- **We lived in heaven before earth:** Our existence did not begin at mortal birth

**Supporting doctrine:**
- **Abraham 3:22-23** - "Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was...and there stood one among them that was like unto God"
- **Jeremiah 1:5** - "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee"
- **D&C 93:29** - "Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be"

---

## 2. Symbolic and Typological References to Christ

Beyond the direct statements in the JST, Genesis 2 contains rich symbolic testimony of Jesus Christ:

### A. The Seventh Day Rest - Christ as Our Sabbath Rest (Genesis 2:2-3)

**"And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it."** (Genesis 2:2-3)

**Symbolic meaning:** Christ's rest on the seventh day is a profound type pointing to:
- **The rest from sin through Christ's Atonement:** Just as God rested after Creation, we find rest from sin through Christ
- **Christ's finished work:** "It is finished" (John 19:30)—just as Creation was complete, so is the Atonement
- **The millennial rest:** Christ will rest with His people during the Millennium
- **Eternal rest in God's presence:** The ultimate Sabbath is exaltation in the celestial kingdom

**Supporting scriptures:**
- **Hebrews 4:9-10** - "There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his"
- **Matthew 11:28-29** - "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me...and ye shall find rest unto your souls"
- **D&C 84:24** - "He that received the fulness of the gospel...entereth into the rest of the Lord"

**Application:** Just as the seventh day was blessed and sanctified as a day of rest, Christ invites us to enter His rest through covenant obedience and faith.

### B. The Tree of Life - Christ as the Source of Eternal Life (Genesis 2:9)

**"And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."** (Genesis 2:9)

**Symbolic meaning:** The Tree of Life is one of the most powerful symbols of Jesus Christ in all scripture:
- **Christ is the source of eternal life:** Just as the Tree gives life, Christ gives eternal life
- **Positioned in the center:** Christ is at the center of God's plan
- **Access requires worthiness:** After the Fall, cherubim guard the way (Genesis 3:24), just as we must be worthy to receive Christ's gift
- **The fruit is desirable:** Christ's gift of eternal life is "most desirable above all things" (1 Nephi 11:22)

**Supporting scriptures:**
- **1 Nephi 11:21-22** - The Tree of Life represents "the love of God"—manifest in sending His Son
- **1 Nephi 15:36** - "The tree of life...is a representation of the tree of life, which is the love of God; and...the most desirable above all things"
- **Revelation 22:2, 14** - "The tree of life...and blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life"
- **Alma 32:41-42** - Faith, if nurtured, becomes a tree "springing up unto everlasting life"

**Application:** Just as the Tree of Life stood in Eden offering immortality, Christ stands at the center of the plan of salvation offering eternal life to all who come unto Him.

### C. The Breath of Life - Christ as the Giver of Life (Genesis 2:7)

**"And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."** (Genesis 2:7)

**Symbolic meaning:** Christ's act of breathing life into Adam powerfully symbolizes:
- **Christ as the source of all life:** He gives both physical and spiritual life
- **The intimate nature of creation:** This is personal, not distant—He breathed into Adam's nostrils
- **The gift of agency:** Man became a "living soul" with the power to choose
- **Spiritual birth parallels physical birth:** Just as Christ gave Adam physical life, He gives us spiritual rebirth

**Supporting scriptures:**
- **John 20:22** - Jesus "breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost"
- **Mosiah 4:2** - Christ is the source "of all creation, both in heaven and in earth"
- **Acts 17:28** - "In him we live, and move, and have our being"
- **D&C 88:13** - "The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things"

**Theological insight:** The same breath that gave Adam life was the breath that Christ gave to His disciples after His resurrection (John 20:22), symbolizing spiritual rebirth. Christ both creates life and renews life.

### D. The Garden of Eden - A Type of the Celestial Kingdom (Genesis 2:8-15)

**"And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed."** (Genesis 2:8)

**Symbolic meaning:** The Garden of Eden is a type and shadow of the celestial kingdom:
- **Paradise prepared by Christ:** Just as He prepared Eden for Adam, He prepares mansions for us (John 14:2)
- **A place of God's presence:** In Eden, God walked and talked with Adam (Genesis 3:8)—in the celestial kingdom, we dwell with God
- **Perfect provision:** Every need was met—symbolic of God's complete provision for His children
- **Labor with purpose:** Adam was to "dress it and keep it" (v. 15)—work in God's kingdom is purposeful and joyful
- **A place of innocence:** Adam and Eve were "not ashamed" (v. 25)—symbolizing the pure, sinless state of those made clean through Christ

**Supporting scriptures:**
- **2 Nephi 2:25** - "Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy"
- **Luke 23:43** - Jesus to the thief: "To day shalt thou be with me in paradise"
- **Alma 40:12** - "The spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise"

**Application:** Christ planted Eden as a perfect environment for Adam and Eve. Through His Atonement, He prepares a far greater paradise—the celestial kingdom—for all who follow Him.

### E. The River from Eden - Christ as Living Water (Genesis 2:10)

**"And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads."** (Genesis 2:10)

**Symbolic meaning:** The river flowing from Eden to water the garden symbolizes Christ as the source of living water:
- **Water gives life:** The river sustained all life in Eden, just as Christ sustains our spiritual life
- **Flows from the source:** Water originates in Eden (God's presence), just as living water flows from Christ
- **Divides to reach all:** The river became "four heads," spreading throughout the earth—Christ's gospel reaches all nations
- **Continuous flow:** The river never stopped—Christ's grace and mercy are infinite and eternal

**Supporting scriptures:**
- **John 4:13-14** - "Whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst...shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life"
- **John 7:37-38** - "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink"
- **Revelation 22:1** - "A pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb"
- **1 Nephi 11:25** - The "fountain of living waters" represents "the love of God," manifest in Christ

**Application:** Just as the river watered all of Eden, giving life to every plant, Christ's living water—His gospel, His grace, His Atonement—gives spiritual life to all who drink.

### F. The Creation of Eve from Adam's Rib - Christ and His Bride, the Church (Genesis 2:21-23)

**"And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man."** (Genesis 2:21-22)

**Symbolic meaning:** This profound event is a type of Christ and His Church:
- **The deep sleep:** Adam's sleep prefigures Christ's death—from which came His bride, the Church
- **Taken from his side:** Just as Eve came from Adam's side, the Church was born from Christ's pierced side on the cross
- **Bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh:** The Church is inseparably connected to Christ—we are His body
- **God as the matchmaker:** Just as God brought Eve to Adam, God brings souls to Christ
- **Made to be one:** Marriage symbolizes the mystical union between Christ and His Church

**Supporting scriptures:**
- **Ephesians 5:25-32** - "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it...This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church"
- **John 19:34** - "One of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water"
- **Revelation 19:7-8** - "The marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready"
- **D&C 109:73-74** - The Saints as the bride awaiting the bridegroom

**Theological insight:** Paul explicitly identifies this passage as speaking of Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5:31-32). Just as Eve was created from Adam to be his eternal companion, the Church—the collective body of the faithful—is created through Christ's sacrifice to be His eternal bride.

### G. Marriage as an Eternal Ordinance - Christ as the Author of Eternal Marriage (Genesis 2:24)

**"Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."** (Genesis 2:24)

**Symbolic meaning:** The first marriage, performed by Christ in Eden, establishes eternal principles:
- **Marriage ordained by God:** Not a human invention, but a divine ordinance established by Christ
- **Leaving and cleaving:** Symbolizes covenant commitment—leaving old life, cleaving to new covenant relationship
- **One flesh:** Represents complete unity—as Christ and the Father are one, so husband and wife become one
- **Pattern for eternity:** Establishes that marriage and family are central to God's eternal plan

**Supporting scriptures:**
- **D&C 131:1-4** - "In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees...And in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]"
- **D&C 132:19-20** - Marriage sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise "shall be of full force when they are out of the world"
- **Matthew 19:4-6** - Jesus affirms God's original design: "What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder"

**Application:** Christ instituted marriage in Eden as an eternal ordinance. Through temple sealing, He restores marriage to its original, eternal design—enabling families to be together forever.

## 3. Doctrinal Connections to Christ's Role in Genesis 2

### A. Christ as the Personal Creator of Mankind

**Doctrine:** Jesus Christ personally and intimately formed Adam's body and breathed life into him. This was not a distant, mechanical process—it was tender, personal, and purposeful.

**Scriptural foundation:**
- **Moses 3:7** - "And I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life"
- **Mosiah 4:2** - "O how you ought to thank your heavenly King...for creating you from the beginning"
- **3 Nephi 9:15** - "I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are"

**Application:** Understanding that Christ personally formed us helps us recognize:
- **Our infinite worth:** We are not cosmic accidents but purposeful creations of the Son of God
- **His intimate knowledge of us:** He who formed our bodies knows every detail of our physical and spiritual makeup
- **His right to redeem us:** The Creator has both the power and the right to save His creation
- **Our accountability to Him:** We are accountable to the One who gave us life

### B. Agency and Commandments - Christ as the Lawgiver

**Doctrine:** Christ gave the first commandment to Adam, establishing the principle of agency and moral law.

**The commandment:**
- **Moses 3:16-17** - "And I, the Lord God, commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."

**Significance:** This establishes:
- **Agency is essential:** "Thou mayest choose for thyself"—God will not force obedience
- **Commandments define boundaries:** Christ gives commandments to protect, not to restrict
- **Consequences are real:** "Thou shalt surely die"—choices have eternal consequences
- **Opposition is necessary:** The presence of the forbidden tree creates the opposition necessary for growth

**Supporting scriptures:**
- **2 Nephi 2:11, 16** - "For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things...Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself"
- **D&C 29:39** - "It must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves"
- **Moses 7:32** - "I gave unto man his agency"

**Application:** Christ gave commandments because He loves us and wants us to return to Him. Agency—the power to choose—is His gift, enabling us to become like Him.

### C. The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil - Preparing for Christ's Atonement

**Doctrine:** The tree of knowledge of good and evil was placed in the Garden as part of God's plan, enabling the Fall—which made the Atonement necessary.

**Scriptural insight:**
- **2 Nephi 2:15-16** - "And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man...the Lord God placed cherubim and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of the fruit—And after Adam and Eve had partaken of the forbidden fruit...Adam began to till the earth"
- **2 Nephi 2:22-25** - "If Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen...And they would have had no children...Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy"

**Significance:**
- **The Fall was foreordained:** God knew Adam would partake, and it was necessary for the plan
- **Death entered through the Fall:** Making resurrection through Christ necessary
- **Mortality enabled progression:** Only through opposition and experience could we become like God
- **The Atonement was planned before the Fall:** Christ's sacrifice was prepared from the foundation of the world

**Supporting scriptures:**
- **Alma 12:22-24** - God prepared a plan of redemption from the foundation of the world
- **1 Peter 1:19-20** - Christ was "foreordained before the foundation of the world"
- **Revelation 13:8** - The Lamb "slain from the foundation of the world"

**Application:** The tree of knowledge was not a trap—it was part of God's plan to allow us to grow, experience opposition, and ultimately need and receive Christ's Atonement.

### D. Christ Prepares a Place for Us

**Doctrine:** Just as Christ prepared the Garden of Eden for Adam and Eve, He prepares a place for us in His Father's kingdom.

**Scriptural foundation:**
- **Moses 3:8** - "And I, the Lord God, planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there I put the man whom I had formed"
- **John 14:2-3** - "In my Father's house are many mansions...I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself"
- **D&C 81:6** - "The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth"

**Significance:**
- **Christ is thoughtful and purposeful:** He doesn't create randomly—He prepares with intention
- **He provides for our needs:** Eden had everything Adam needed—heaven will have everything we need
- **He creates beauty:** "Every tree that is pleasant to the sight"—God values beauty and joy
- **He invites us to His presence:** Just as He placed Adam in Eden, He invites us to dwell with Him

**Application:** Christ is preparing a place for you. Just as He carefully planted Eden with every good thing, He is preparing a mansion in His Father's kingdom customized for you.

## 4. How Genesis 2 Testifies of Jesus Christ and His Mission

### A. Christ's Intimate, Personal Care

Genesis 2 reveals a Creator who is:
- **Personally involved:** He forms man with His hands, breathes life into him, plants the Garden, brings animals to Adam, creates Eve
- **Tender and caring:** He sees that it is "not good" for man to be alone and provides a companion
- **Providing abundantly:** He gives Adam "every tree...pleasant to the sight, and good for food"
- **Teaching and guiding:** He gives commandments and explains consequences

**Teaching application:** Many people see God as distant or impersonal. Genesis 2 reveals that Jesus Christ is intimately involved in our lives. He formed you, knows you, and cares deeply about your happiness.

### B. Christ as the Author of Sacred Ordinances

Genesis 2 shows Christ establishing foundational ordinances:
- **The Sabbath:** Blessed and sanctified as a day of rest (v. 3)
- **Marriage:** Established as an eternal covenant between man and woman (v. 24)
- **Commandments:** Given to teach obedience and protect from harm (vv. 16-17)

**Teaching application:** The ordinances we participate in today—baptism, sacrament, temple marriage—all originate from Christ. He is the author of covenant relationships and sacred rites.

### C. Christ's Pattern of Creating Beauty and Purpose

Everything Christ creates has:
- **Purpose:** "To dress it and to keep it" (v. 15)—work is purposeful
- **Beauty:** Trees "pleasant to the sight" (v. 9)—God values aesthetics
- **Abundance:** "Of every tree...thou mayest freely eat" (v. 16)—God is generous
- **Order:** The river divides into four heads, watering the whole earth (v. 10)—God brings organization

**Teaching application:** Christ doesn't create chaos—He brings order, beauty, purpose, and abundance. When we invite Him into our lives, He does the same for us.

### D. Christ's Foreknowledge and Preparation

Genesis 2 demonstrates that Christ:
- **Created all things spiritually first** (Moses 3:5)—He sees the end from the beginning
- **Prepared for the Fall** by placing the tree of knowledge and warning of consequences
- **Knew marriage would be necessary** for the continuation of humanity
- **Prepared a perfect environment** before placing Adam in it

**Teaching application:** Christ knew the entire plan before the world began. He knew the Fall would occur, knew the Atonement would be necessary, and prepared everything to bring about our eternal happiness. We can trust His timing and His plan.

## 6. Teaching Applications and Testimony-Building Insights

### For Gospel Teachers:

When teaching Genesis 2, help students discover:

**1. Always Use the JST (Moses 3):**
Compare Genesis 2 line-by-line with Moses 3 to reveal Christ explicitly. The JST transforms this from an ancient creation story into a powerful testimony of Jesus Christ.

**2. Key Teaching Moments - The "Christ Connection":**

- **Verse 2-3 (The Sabbath):** Ask: "How does Christ give us rest from sin?" Connect to Matthew 11:28-29
- **Verse 7 (Breath of Life):** Ask: "How does Christ give us spiritual life?" Connect to being born again (Mosiah 27:25)
- **Verse 9 (Tree of Life):** Ask: "What does the Tree of Life represent?" Show 1 Nephi 11:21-25
- **Verse 18 (Not Good to Be Alone):** Ask: "Who said this? When?" Read Moses 3:18—the Father speaking to the Only Begotten
- **Verse 21-22 (Creation of Eve):** Ask: "How does this symbolize Christ and the Church?" Read Ephesians 5:25-32
- **Verse 24 (Marriage):** Ask: "Why is marriage eternal?" Connect to D&C 131:1-4

**3. Three-Column Study Method:**

Create a three-column chart for class:
- Column 1: Genesis 2 (KJV)
- Column 2: Moses 3 (JST)
- Column 3: How it testifies of Christ

Have students fill in column 3 as you study together.

**4. Testimony-Building Questions:**

- "What does it mean to you that Christ personally formed Adam—and you?"
- "How does knowing Christ prepared Eden for Adam help you trust His preparations for you?"
- "What does Christ's statement 'it is not good that the man should be alone' teach about His concern for your happiness?"
- "How does the tree of life give you hope for eternal life?"
- "What does it mean that you were created spiritually before you were born physically?"

**5. Object Lessons:**

- **A plant or flower:** Show how it needs water (Christ as living water), light (Christ as light), and care (Christ's nurturing)
- **A wedding ring:** Discuss how marriage points to Christ's covenant relationship with His Church
- **A photograph:** Talk about being created in Christ's image—what does that mean for our potential?

### For Personal Study:

**1. Prayerful Pondering:**
Read Genesis 2 and Moses 3 side-by-side, highlighting every occurrence of "I, the Lord God." Personalize each statement by asking: "What does it mean that Christ personally did this?"

**2. Cross-Reference Study:**
For each verse in Genesis 2, find at least one scripture about Christ that connects to the theme. Create a "Christ-centered chain reference" in your scriptures.

**3. Journal Prompts:**

Write responses to these questions in your journal:
- "What does it mean to me personally that Christ formed me and breathed life into me?"
- "How have I experienced Christ bringing 'rest' into my life, like the Sabbath rest?"
- "In what ways is Christ preparing a place for me, just as He prepared Eden?"
- "How does understanding that I was created spiritually before physically affect my sense of identity and purpose?"
- "What does it mean to become 'one flesh' in marriage—and how does that point to becoming one with Christ?"
- "How can I partake of the Tree of Life (Christ) today?"

**4. Meditation Exercise:**

Close your eyes and imagine:
- Christ's hands forming Adam from the dust—realize those same hands formed you
- Christ breathing life into Adam's nostrils—feel Him giving you the breath of life
- Christ walking through Eden with Adam—know that He walks with you today
- Christ bringing Eve to Adam—recognize His tender care in providing for all our needs
- Christ commanding Adam—hear His voice giving you counsel through the Holy Ghost

**5. Create Visual Connections:**

Draw or create a diagram showing how each element in Genesis 2 points to Christ:
- Sabbath rest → Rest from sin through Christ
- Tree of Life → Eternal life through Christ
- Breath of life → Spiritual rebirth through Christ
- Garden → Celestial kingdom prepared by Christ
- River → Living water from Christ
- Eve from Adam's side → Church from Christ's pierced side
- Marriage → Christ and His bride, the Church

## 7. Verse-by-Verse Christ-Centered Insights

### Verses 1-3: The Sabbath Rest Points to Christ's Finished Work

**KJV:** "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work...and he rested...And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it."

**JST (Moses 3:2-3):** "And on the seventh day I, God, ended my work, and all things which I had made; and I rested on the seventh day from all my work, and all things which I had made were finished, and I, God, saw that they were good; And I, God, blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it."

**Christ-centered insight:**
- Christ's work of creation was complete and perfect—"all things...were finished...were good"
- The rest foreshadows Christ's completed Atonement: "It is finished" (John 19:30)
- The blessed and sanctified Sabbath points to the rest we find in Christ (Hebrews 4:9-10)
- Christ's rest after creation parallels our eternal rest when His work in us is complete

**Application:** Just as Christ rested after creating a perfect world, He offers us rest from sin and struggle. The Sabbath day reminds us weekly to enter His rest through covenant keeping.

### Verses 4-6: The Dual Creation—Spiritual and Physical

**JST addition (Moses 3:5):** "For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth. For I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men; and not yet a man to till the ground; for in heaven created I them."

**Christ-centered insight:**
- Christ created us spiritually first—we existed with Him before earth life
- We knew Christ in the pre-mortal existence; He knew us
- Physical creation follows spiritual pattern—Christ sees the end from the beginning
- This confirms our eternal nature and Christ's eternal plan

**Application:** You are not a random accident of nature. Christ knew you and created you spiritually before you were born. Your life has eternal purpose designed by Him.

### Verse 7: Christ Breathes Life into Adam

**KJV:** "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."

**JST (Moses 3:7):** "And I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul, the first flesh upon the earth, the first man also."

**Christ-centered insight:**
- Christ personally formed Adam—intimate, hands-on creation
- He breathed life—the same breath He gave His disciples (John 20:22)
- "Living soul" = Christ gives both physical and spiritual life
- This parallels spiritual rebirth: Christ breathes new life into us through the gospel

**Application:** The same Christ who breathed physical life into Adam breathes spiritual life into you through the Holy Ghost. He is the source of all life.

### Verse 8: Christ Prepares Paradise

**JST (Moses 3:8):** "And I, the Lord God, planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there I put the man whom I had formed."

**Christ-centered insight:**
- Christ personally planted the Garden—He is a preparer, a planner
- He prepared paradise before placing Adam there—He prepares before He asks
- This foreshadows Christ preparing mansions for us (John 14:2-3)
- Eden is a type of the celestial kingdom—perfect, abundant, beautiful

**Application:** Christ is preparing a place for you right now. Just as He carefully planted Eden with every good thing for Adam, He is preparing a perfect place for you in His Father's kingdom.

### Verse 9: The Tree of Life—Christ Offers Eternal Life

**KJV:** "And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."

**Christ-centered insight:**
- The Tree of Life represents Christ and His gift of eternal life
- Positioned "in the midst"—Christ is central to God's plan
- "Pleasant to the sight"—Christ's gospel is beautiful and desirable
- The tree of knowledge enabled the Fall, making Christ's Atonement necessary

**Application:** Christ is the Tree of Life. His gospel is pleasant, His fruit is desirable, and He stands at the center of all things, offering you eternal life.

### Verses 10-14: The River of Living Water

**KJV:** "And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads."

**Christ-centered insight:**
- The river symbolizes Christ as the source of living water
- It originates in Eden (God's presence) and spreads throughout the earth
- Four heads = the gospel reaching to the four corners of the earth
- Continuous flow = Christ's infinite grace and mercy

**Application:** Christ offers you living water. Just as the river watered all of Eden, His grace and mercy are sufficient for all your needs (John 4:13-14, 7:37-38).

### Verses 15-17: Christ Gives Commandments and Agency

**JST (Moses 3:16-17):** "And I, the Lord God, commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die."

**Christ-centered insight:**
- Christ is the Lawgiver—He gives commandments because He loves us
- "Thou mayest choose for thyself"—Christ honors our agency
- Commandments protect and guide; they don't restrict freedom
- Consequences are real and explained—Christ is honest and clear
- The forbidden tree creates necessary opposition (2 Nephi 2:11)

**Application:** Christ gives you agency—the power to choose. His commandments are not restrictions but loving guidance to help you return to Him. Choose wisely.

### Verse 18: The Father and Son Counsel Together About Eve

**JST (Moses 3:18):** "And I, the Lord God, said unto mine Only Begotten, that it was not good that the man should be alone; wherefore, I will make an help meet for him."

**Christ-centered insight:**
- The Father speaks to His Only Begotten—revealing the divine council
- Marriage was planned in heaven before it was instituted on earth
- "Not good...alone"—God values relationships and companionship
- "Help meet" = equal partner, not subordinate—reflects Christ's partnership with the Father
- This reveals Christ's pre-mortal participation in planning our happiness

**Application:** The Godhead counseled about your happiness before you were born. Marriage and family are not just earthly conveniences—they are eternal ordinances planned by God.

### Verses 19-20: Christ Brings Order and Purpose

**JST (Moses 3:19):** "And out of the ground I, the Lord God, formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and commanded that they should come unto Adam, to see what he would call them; and they were also living souls; for I, God, breathed into them the breath of life."

**Christ-centered insight:**
- Christ gave life to all creatures—"I...breathed into them the breath of life"
- He brings order by having Adam name the animals—purposeful work
- Adam participates in creation by naming—we partner with Christ in His work
- This shows Christ's patience and His desire for us to use our agency

**Application:** Christ invites you to partner with Him in His work. Just as Adam named the animals, you have stewardship and creative power given by Christ.

### Verses 21-22: Eve from Adam's Side—Christ and His Church

**KJV:** "And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man."

**Christ-centered insight:**
- Adam's deep sleep prefigures Christ's death
- Eve from Adam's side parallels the Church from Christ's pierced side (John 19:34)
- "Bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh" = the Church is Christ's body (Ephesians 5:30)
- God as matchmaker = God brings souls to Christ
- Paul explicitly calls this a "great mystery" referring to "Christ and the church" (Ephesians 5:32)

**Application:** Just as God created Eve for Adam, Christ creates His Church—His bride—through His sacrifice. You are part of Christ's body, inseparably connected to Him.

### Verses 23-24: Marriage as an Eternal Ordinance

**KJV:** "And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."

**Christ-centered insight:**
- Marriage established by Christ from the beginning
- "One flesh" symbolizes complete unity—as Christ and the Father are one (John 17:21)
- "Cleave" = covenant commitment, eternal bond
- This ordinance points to the eternal nature of family relationships
- Christ instituted marriage to teach us about covenant relationships with Him

**Application:** Marriage is not a human tradition—it is a divine ordinance instituted by Christ to teach eternal principles of covenant, unity, and love. Through temple sealing, Christ restores marriage to its original, eternal design.

### Verse 25: Innocence and Purity Before the Fall

**KJV:** "And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."

**Christ-centered insight:**
- Their nakedness without shame symbolizes innocence and purity
- This represents the state of those made clean through Christ's Atonement
- After the Fall, shame entered (Genesis 3:7)—but Christ removes shame
- This points to our future glorified state in Christ's presence—pure, unashamed

**Application:** Through Christ's Atonement, you can be made pure and clean, without shame. He offers to clothe you in robes of righteousness, restoring the innocence lost in the Fall.

## 8. Conclusion and Testimony

Genesis 2 is a profound testimony of Jesus Christ's intimate involvement in the creation and care of His children. When illuminated by the Joseph Smith Translation (Moses 3) and modern revelation, we see clearly that:

**Jesus Christ is:**
- The personal Creator who formed Adam with His hands and breathed life into him
- The gardener who planted Eden and prepared paradise for His children
- The Lawgiver who gave the first commandment and honored agency
- The source of the Tree of Life, offering eternal life to all who come unto Him
- The provider of living water, sustaining all life spiritually and physically
- The author of marriage, establishing eternal covenant relationships
- The One who instituted the Sabbath as a reminder of the rest He offers
- Jehovah, the LORD God of the Old Testament who speaks in first person in Moses 3

**Genesis 2 testifies that:**
- Christ's work is personal and intimate—He forms, breathes, plants, provides, commands, creates
- Christ prepares for us before placing us in our circumstances
- Christ values relationships, companionship, and family—they are divine, not merely social constructs
- Christ created us spiritually before physically—we have eternal identity and purpose
- Christ gives us agency and honors our choices, while clearly teaching consequences
- Christ's creations are perfect, beautiful, abundant, and purposeful
- Christ's ordinances (Sabbath, marriage, commandments) are eternal and sacred

**Symbolic Testimonies of Christ:**
- The Sabbath rest = Rest from sin through Christ's Atonement
- The Tree of Life = Eternal life offered by Christ
- The breath of life = Spiritual rebirth through Christ
- The Garden of Eden = The celestial kingdom prepared by Christ
- The river from Eden = Living water flowing from Christ
- Eve from Adam's side = The Church born from Christ's sacrifice
- Marriage = The covenant union between Christ and His people

**Practical Application:**

Understanding Christ in Genesis 2 should transform how we:
- **View our creation:** We are purposefully designed by Christ, with infinite worth and potential
- **View the Sabbath:** It is Christ's gift of rest, a weekly reminder to enter His peace
- **View marriage and family:** These are eternal ordinances instituted by Christ, not temporary social arrangements
- **View our bodies:** They were formed by Christ's hands and are sacred temples
- **View agency:** Christ honors our choices; we are free to choose but accountable for consequences
- **View paradise:** Christ prepares a place for us, just as He prepared Eden for Adam
- **View our identity:** We were created spiritually first—we are eternal beings with divine heritage

**Personal Testimony:**

I testify that Jesus Christ is the Creator of heaven and earth, the God of Adam, the Jehovah of the Old Testament. He personally formed our first parents, breathed life into them, prepared paradise for them, and established sacred ordinances for their happiness and eternal progression.

The same Christ who planted the Garden of Eden is preparing mansions for us in His Father's kingdom. The same Christ who breathed physical life into Adam breathes spiritual life into us through the Holy Ghost. The same Christ who created Eve and brought her to Adam creates His Church and invites us to become His bride.

Genesis 2 is not merely ancient history—it is a powerful testimony that Jesus Christ knows you, formed you, has prepared for you, and invites you to enter His rest, partake of His living water, eat from His Tree of Life, and dwell with Him forever in the paradise He has prepared.

May we read Genesis 2 with new eyes, seeing not just the story of Adam and Eve in Eden, but the testimony of our Creator, Redeemer, and King—Jesus Christ, who loved us enough to form us, prepare for us, die for us, and prepare eternal mansions for us.

The Tree of Life stands in the midst of the Garden, and it represents Jesus Christ. He invites you today: "Come unto me...and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28). "I am the resurrection, and the life" (John 11:25). "I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever" (John 6:51).

Jesus Christ is the Tree of Life. Partake of His fruit, drink of His living water, and live forever.
