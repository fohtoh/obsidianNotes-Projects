# Notes

## what to look for
- How can we find [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] in the writings of the old Testament?  
- How can we also see [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] in our lives from seeing him in the old testament
- Learn about and watch for covenants

## Jesus
When the leaders of the [[Jews]] challenged [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]] about His identity, He declared, “Before Abraham was, I am.” These words shocked the people who heard Jesus, and they were ready to stone Him.

The Jews were upset because Jesus was claiming to be God Himself.

Here’s why this was so shocking:
**The Divine Name “I AM”**
When [[Moses]] asked God His name at the burning bush (Exodus 3:13-15), God responded: “I AM WHO I AM” and told Moses to tell the Israelites that “I AM has sent me to you.” This name (YHWH in Hebrew, often translated as “the LORD”) was God’s personal, covenant name - the most sacred name in Judaism.

**Jesus’ Deliberate Claim**
When Jesus said “Before Abraham was, I AM” (not “I was”), He was doing two things:
1. **Claiming pre-existence** - He existed before Abraham, who lived roughly 2,000 years earlier
2. **Using God’s personal name** - He identified Himself with the “I AM” of Exodus 3:14

**Why This Warranted Stoning**
The Jewish leaders immediately understood what Jesus was claiming. In their view, this was blasphemy - a man claiming to be equal with God, taking God’s sacred name upon Himself. Under Jewish law (Leviticus 24:16), blasphemy was punishable by death through stoning.

Their reaction shows they didn’t misunderstand Jesus - they understood Him perfectly. He wasn’t just claiming to be a prophet or teacher; He was claiming to be the eternal, self-existent God who revealed Himself to Moses. This is why they picked up stones immediately, without any further discussion needed.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
