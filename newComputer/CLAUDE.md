## Current Build Selection

### Premium Build (~$2,320)

| Component | Selection | Price | Key Reason |
|-----------|-----------|-------|------------|
| CPU | AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D | $480 | Best gaming CPU available, 35% faster than Intel alternatives |
| GPU | NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti | $899 | Superior 1440p performance, DLSS 4, excellent for Lightroom |
| Motherboard | MSI MAG X870 Tomahawk | $280 | Perfect feature set, X870 chipset, excellent VRM |
| RAM | Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 32GB | $110 | Optimal speed for AMD, great value |
| Storage | WD Black SN7100 2TB | $150 | Excellent PCIe 4.0 performance |
| PSU | Corsair RM850e 850W | $130 | Reliable, fully modular, ATX 3.1 compliant |
| Cooling | Arctic Liquid Freezer III Pro 360mm | $140 | Outstanding cooling performance |
| Case | Fractal Design North | $130 | Beautiful design, excellent airflow |

**Total**: ~$2,319

### Alternative Configurations

**Value Build** (~$1,840): Uses AMD RX 9070 XT GPU, B650 motherboard, air cooling, and budget case for ~$480 savings with minimal performance loss

**Ultra-Premium Build** (~$3,338): Ryzen 9 9950X3D, premium motherboard, PCIe 5.0 storage, 1000W Titanium PSU for zero compromises

## Key Decisions & Rationale

### CPU: AMD vs Intel
- **Winner**: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D
- **Reason**: 35% faster gaming performance than Intel Core i9-14900K and 30% faster than Core Ultra 9 285K
- **Platform Advantage**: AM5 socket supported through 2025+ for easy upgrades

### GPU: NVIDIA vs AMD
- **Winner**: NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti (premium choice)
- **Reasoning**:
  - DLSS 4 with AI frame generation (game-changing performance boost)
  - Superior ray tracing performance
  - NVIDIA Studio drivers optimize Lightroom performance
  - 16GB VRAM for future-proofing
- **Alternative**: AMD RX 9070 XT at $649 offers excellent value (90-95% performance for $250 less)

### Memory
- **Capacity**: 32GB (sweet spot for gaming + photo editing)
- **Speed**: DDR5-6000 (optimal for AMD Ryzen 9000 series)
- **Type**: DDR5 (current generation standard)

### Storage Strategy
- **Primary**: 2TB NVMe PCIe 4.0 for OS and games
- **Future**: Add secondary 2TB drive for photo library expansion if needed
- **PCIe 4.0 vs 5.0**: PCIe 4.0 chosen for value; PCIe 5.0 shows no real-world benefit in gaming/Lightroom

### Power Supply
- **850W**: Sufficient for RTX 5070 Ti + Ryzen 9800X3D with headroom
- **Modular**: Fully modular for clean cable management
- **Efficiency**: 80+ Gold standard

### Cooling
- **360mm AIO**: Chosen for optimal cooling and quiet operation
- **Alternative**: Thermalright Peerless Assassin 120 SE air cooler ($40) offers 90% of performance for budget builds

## Performance Targets

- **Gaming**: 100+ FPS at 1440p high/ultra settings (144+ FPS with DLSS 4)
- **Photo Editing**: Smooth Lightroom catalog navigation, fast exports, handles large RAW files
- **Multitasking**: Gaming + browser + Discord simultaneously without issues

## Future Upgrade Paths

- **CPU**: AM5 platform supports future Ryzen processors (e.g., 9950X3D)
- **GPU**: 850W PSU supports RTX 5080 upgrade (5090 may need PSU upgrade)
- **RAM**: Easy expansion to 64GB if needed for heavy workloads
- **Storage**: Multiple M.2 slots available for expansion

## Component Selection Philosophy

1. **Gaming First**: Prioritized CPU and GPU with best gaming performance
2. **Future-Proofing**: Selected components with longevity and upgrade paths
3. **Quality Over Features**: Focused on reliability and performance over RGB and aesthetics
4. **Value Optimization**: Premium build balances performance and cost; value build available for tighter budgets
5. **Latest Generation**: All components from 2025 latest releases (AMD 9000 series, RTX 5000 series, etc.)

## Research Sources

All recommendations based on 2025 reviews and benchmarks from:
- Tom's Hardware
