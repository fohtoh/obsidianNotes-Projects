## FAQ

### Do I need 64GB of RAM?
**No, not for your use case.** 32GB is more than sufficient for gaming and Lightroom. You'd only need 64GB if you:
- Work with massive panoramas (100+ images)
- Do heavy video editing
- Run multiple virtual machines

### Should I wait for next-generation components?
**No.** The 2025 components recommended here represent the latest generation:
- AMD Ryzen 9000 series (9800X3D is latest)
- NVIDIA RTX 5000 series (just released)
- AMD Radeon RX 9000 series (just released)

This is an excellent time to build.

### Can I save money by going Intel?
**Not really, and you'd lose performance.** Intel's current offerings trail AMD in gaming, and the platform is nearing end-of-life. The cost savings are minimal (~$30) and not worth the performance loss.

### PCIe 4.0 vs PCIe 5.0 SSD - does it matter?
**For gaming and Lightroom, not significantly.** PCIe 4.0 SSDs like the WD Black SN7100 are already extremely fast (7,000+ MB/s). PCIe 5.0 drives are faster in benchmarks but don't translate to noticeable real-world improvements in game loading or Lightroom performance. Save your money.

### Air cooling vs liquid cooling?
**Both are viable:**
- **Air cooling** (like Thermalright Peerless Assassin): Cheaper, no pump failure risk, quiet, excellent performance
- **Liquid cooling** (like Arctic Liquid Freezer III): Better cooling performance, often quieter under load, better aesthetics

For the Ryzen 9800X3D, either works well. Choose based on budget and preference.

### Do I need RGB lighting?
**Absolutely not.** It's purely aesthetic. Non-RGB components often cost less. The recommendations above include some RGB options, but you can opt for non-RGB versions to save $20-50.

### Can this PC handle 4K gaming?
**Yes, but 1440p is the sweet spot.** The RTX 5070 Ti and RX 9070 XT can handle 4K gaming with DLSS/FSR enabled, but you'll need to lower some settings in the most demanding titles. For native 4K at ultra settings, you'd want an RTX 5080 or 5090.

### What monitor should I get?
Since you mentioned 2K, I assume you have a 1440p monitor. If shopping for a new one, look for:
- **Resolution**: 2560x1440 (1440p/2K)
- **Refresh Rate**: 144Hz or higher (165Hz/180Hz ideal)
- **Panel Type**: IPS for color accuracy (photo editing) or VA for better contrast
- **Adaptive Sync**: G-Sync Compatible or FreeSync
- **Color Gamut**: 100% sRGB minimum, Adobe RGB coverage is a bonus for photo editing

---

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Budget**: Determine if you're targeting the value build (~$1,850) or premium build (~$2,320)
2. **Check Availability**: Component availability and pricing can vary by region
3. **Watch for Sales**: Monitor r/buildapcsales or similar for deals
4. **Plan Assembly**: Decide if you'll build yourself or pay for assembly
5. **Prepare Workspace**: Clear space, gather tools (screwdrivers, zip ties)
6. **Cable Management**: Budget extra time for clean cable routing
7. **Install OS**: Prepare Windows installation media on USB drive
8. **Update Drivers**: Download latest drivers for all components
9. **Benchmark**: Test performance with your favorite games and Lightroom

## Conclusion

This build guide prioritizes:
- **Gaming Excellence**: Best possible performance at 1440p
- **Photo Editing Performance**: Smooth Lightroom workflows
- **Reliability**: Quality components with good warranties
- **Future-Proofing**: Platform longevity and upgrade paths
- **Value**: Balancing performance with cost-effectiveness

The **Premium Build** (~$2,320) represents the sweet spot of performance and value, while the **Value Build** (~$1,840) delivers 90-95% of the performance for those on a tighter budget.

Both builds will absolutely dominate 1440p gaming and handle Lightroom with ease.
