## Summary

This tutorial video explains different frame rates and shutter speeds for sports videography. The creator, Peter Sarellas (a Toronto-based sports videographer), breaks down when to use each frame rate based on the type of content being filmed.

## Frame Rates Overview

### 24 FPS (1/50 [[Shutter Speed]])
- **Use Case:** Cinematic frame rate used in movies
- **Best For:** Pre-game, post-game, and timeout speeches
- **Pros:**
  - Creates natural motion blur
  - Provides highest image quality per frame
  - Higher resolution available (4K on most cameras)
- **Cons:**
  - Not recommended for action shots (too much blur)
  - Subject becomes unclear during fast movement

### 30 FPS (1/60 [[Shutter Speed]])
- **Use Case:** Broadcast television standard
- **Best For:** Content that will be used in broadcasts
- **Pros:**
  - Essential for broadcast compatibility
  - Can be slowed to 80% speed on a 24fps timeline
  - Similar motion blur to 24fps (barely noticeable difference)
- **Cons:**
  - Slightly lower quality than 24fps
  - Limited slow-motion capability

### 60 FPS (1/120 [[Shutter Speed]])
- **Use Case:** First frame rate considered "slow motion"
- **Best For:** Entry-level sports videography
- **Pros:**
  - Can be slowed to 40% speed on 24fps timeline
  - Less motion blur, subjects appear clearer
  - Good balance between quality and slow-motion capability
  - Common on entry-level cameras
- **Cons:**
  - Limited slow-motion compared to higher frame rates
  - May not create dramatic enough effect for highlight reels

### 120 FPS (1/250 [[Shutter Speed]])
- **Use Case:** Most popular for sports videography
- **Best For:** Action shots, highlight reels
- **Pros:**
  - Can be slowed to 20% speed (very dramatic)
  - Creates the "jittery" effect with minimal motion blur
  - Peter Sarellas films 90% of content at this rate
  - Excellent for unpredictable action moments
- **Cons:**
  - Lower quality per frame compared to 24fps
  - Larger file sizes
  - Example: A7 III at 1080p 120fps = 0.83 megabits/frame vs 4K 24fps = 4.167 megabits/frame

### 240 FPS (1/500 [[Shutter Speed]])
- **Use Case:** Super slow motion
- **Best For:** Specific dramatic moments
- **Pros:**
  - Can be slowed to 10% speed (extremely dramatic)
  - Creates photo-like sequences with almost no motion blur
  - Makes videos stand out with unique look
  - Excellent for motion tracking due to clarity
- **Cons:**
  - Significantly reduced image quality per frame
  - Very large file sizes
  - Should be used sparingly, not as primary frame rate

## Key Technique: [[Over-Cranking]]

**Definition:** Using a faster [[Shutter Speed]] than the standard 180-degree shutter angle (which is 1/double your frame rate)

**Example:** Filming at 120fps with 1/400 [[Shutter Speed]] instead of 1/250

### Why Over-Crank?
- Reduces motion blur during fast action
- Makes subjects clearer when camera is moving quickly
- Easier for motion tracking effects (especially eye tracking)
- Creates popular Instagram-style "photo sequence" look
- Better subject definition during camera whips and pans

### Peter's Typical Settings:
- **Action at 120fps:** 1/400 [[Shutter Speed]] (minimum)
- **Action at 24fps:** 1/250 [[Shutter Speed]] (minimum)
- Even at 240fps, uses 1/400-1/500 for the look

### Important Caveat:
**Never sacrifice proper [[Exposure]] for [[Over-Cranking]].** Proper [[Exposure]] is always more important than achieving the over-cranked look. Faster [[Shutter Speed]]s let in less light, so only over-crank when lighting conditions allow.

## Decision Framework

### Choose Your Frame Rate Based On:

1. **Slow Motion Needs**
   - No slow motion needed → 24/30fps
   - Subtle slow motion → 60fps
   - Dramatic slow motion → 120fps
   - Extreme slow motion → 240fps

2. **Broadcast Requirements**
   - Will be broadcast → 30fps
   - Cinema/web only → 24fps or higher

3. **Lighting Conditions**
   - Poor lighting → Lower frame rates, slower [[Shutter Speed]]
   - Good lighting → Higher frame rates, faster [[Shutter Speed]] ([[Over-Cranking]] possible)

4. **Quality vs. Flexibility**
   - Maximum quality needed → 24/30fps
   - Balanced quality + slow motion → 60fps
   - Prioritize slow motion → 120fps

5. **Story Being Told**
   - Emotional interviews/speeches → 24fps
   - Game action highlights → 120fps
   - Specific hero moments → 240fps

## Technical Notes

### 180-Degree Shutter Angle Rule
The "natural" [[Shutter Speed]] is **1/double your frame rate**:
- 24fps → 1/50 [[Shutter Speed]]
- 30fps → 1/60 [[Shutter Speed]]
- 60fps → 1/120 [[Shutter Speed]]
- 120fps → 1/250 [[Shutter Speed]]
- 240fps → 1/500 [[Shutter Speed]]

### Data Rate Comparison (Sony A7 III Example)
- **4K 24fps:** 100 Mbps = 4.167 Mbps per frame
- **1080p 120fps:** 100 Mbps = 0.83 Mbps per frame
- **Quality difference:** ~5x more data per frame at 24fps

### Motion Blur Perception
- 1/50 vs 1/60 [[Shutter Speed]] → Barely perceptible difference
- 1/250+ [[Shutter Speed]] → Noticeably reduced motion blur, "jittery" effect begins
- 1/400-1/500 [[Shutter Speed]] → Minimal motion blur, photo-like sequences

## Main Takeaway

> "There's no one specific frame rate and respective shutter speed that you're going to be able to use 100% of the time. Different types of content are going to require you to film in different frame rates and use different techniques with your camera."

The key is understanding:
- What each frame rate offers
- The trade-offs involved (quality vs. slow motion)
- Your specific shooting situation
- The story you're trying to tell
