**Source:** RISE ZION YouTube Channel

**Date:** November 13, 2025

**Duration:** 31 minutes

## Overview

This video discusses upcoming changes to the LDS Church based on leaked audio from a leadership training meeting given by Elder Brad Wilcox (after his release from the Young Men General Presidency in August 2025). The changes focus on empowering youth and preparing members to live a "higher and holier law" in anticipation of the Second Coming.

## Main Points

### Youth Growth & Statistics

- Record-breaking temple attendance and recommend usage among youth
- Unprecedented numbers of patriarchal blessings being requested (some stakes now have 2-3 patriarchs)
- 80,000+ missionaries currently serving (highest since missionary age was lowered)
- 55 new missions recently opened worldwide
- Church retaining youth at higher rates than any other Christian denomination

### Bishop Role Restructuring

- Bishops instructed by Elder Cook to be "guardrails at the top of the hill for youth" rather than "ambulances at the bottom of the hill for adults"
- Adult counseling responsibilities being delegated to Relief Society and Elders Quorum presidencies
- Focus shifting from perpetual adult crisis management to youth mentoring and protection
- Bishops should act as "judge in Israel, not parole officer" - hear confessions but delegate follow-up care

### Camp Program Changes

- Handbook language updated to require 4-day minimum camps (3 nights)
- Initially proposed 5 days but compromised to 4
- Church committing to purchase additional camp facilities to accommodate longer programs
- Elder Gause (new apostle, former Presiding Bishop) committed: "You make it part of the program and we will buy the camps"
- FSY expanding globally to Ethiopia, Pakistan, Vietnam, and other new countries

### "Higher and Holier Way" Philosophy

- New "For the Strength of Youth" guide emphasizes reasons behind commandments, not just rules
- Shift from checklist obedience to covenant-based discipleship
- Teaching youth to understand "why" behind standards rather than just "what" the rules are
- Focus on changing hearts and motivations, not just behavior
- Comparison to Jesus fulfilling the Law of Moses with a higher law
- Not a book of rules, but a book of reasons

### Teaching Approach Examples

When asked difficult questions, respond with principle-based answers:
- Why keep high standards? "Jesus Christ will help you"
- Why go to church/mission/pay tithing? "Because I love God and my neighbor"
- Why avoid pornography? "Because I want to walk in God's light"
- Why live chastity and Word of Wisdom? "My body is sacred"
- Why not cheat? "Truth will make you free"

### Youth Leadership Expansion

- Youth-led sacrament meetings being implemented in wards
- Youth organizing entire meetings: prayers, music, talks, themes
- 16-17 year olds becoming mentors to younger youth at camps and FSY
- Youth described as "present leadership core" not just future leaders

### Proposed Ministering Changes (Pending First Presidency Approval)

- Policy change proposed for 14-year-old young women to participate in formal in-person ministering assignments
- Currently young women can minister, but primarily digitally
- Goal is to prepare youth (especially future missionaries) with real experience visiting homes and teaching
- Youth would be paired with adult companions and assigned to handpicked families
- Start small - perhaps one family per youth, quarterly visits
- Elder Wilcox stated: "Names are coming, sisters. Names are coming. They just went to the First Presidency"
- Meeting with First Presidency occurred on Wednesday (timing relative to the training)

### Key Leadership Quotes

**Elder Cook:** "Bishops, knock it off. Stop it. You have got to start being the guard rail at the top of the hill for the youth and not the ambulance at the bottom of the hill for the adults."

**Elder Gause:** "You make it part of the program and we will buy the camps."

**Elder Wilcox:** "This is not a book of rules. This is a book of reasons... We're trying to help young people step up to a higher law."

**Elder Wilcox:** "In coming years this will take a much more central place in the program."

## Interpretation & Significance

- Changes reflect preparation for the Second Coming
- Youth are fulfilling prophecy and being positioned as current (not just future) leaders
- Emphasis on covenant-based living vs. rule-following applies to all members, not just youth
- Expansion of priesthood power/authority delegation to young women through ministering
- Infrastructure investment showing institutional commitment to youth spiritual development
- Shift from "checklist Christianity" to heart-centered discipleship

## Additional Context

- These changes are described as "quiet revolution" happening behind the scenes
- Some changes already approved and in handbook
- Some changes pending First Presidency approval
- Training meeting was informal but reflected years of Elder Wilcox's experience in youth leadership
- Video creator (Rise Zion channel) interprets these as prophetic preparation for Christ's return
