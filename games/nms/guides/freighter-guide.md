## Freighter Classes

### Class Comparison (C, B, A, S)

#### Storage Capacity
- **C-Class**: Fewest inventory slots
- **B-Class**: Moderate slots
- **A-Class**: Up to 42 general slots + 14 tech slots
- **S-Class**: Up to 48 general slots + 21 tech slots

#### Hyperdrive Performance
**A-Class:**
- Hyperdrive efficiency: 4.0
- Bonus range: 20-30% (maxes at 160%)

**S-Class:**
- Hyperdrive efficiency: 8.0 (twice as far per tank)
- Bonus range: 31-40% (maxes at 180%)

#### Class Bonuses
- **C-Class**: No more than 20% class bonus
- **B-Class**: 20% or more class bonus
- **A-Class**: Higher bonuses
- **S-Class**: Highest bonuses across all stats

#### Price
**Regular Freighters** (15-19 slots):
- 5M - 23M units (C to S)

**Capital Freighters** (24-34 slots):
- 26M - 178M units (C to S)

#### Bottom Line
S-Class freighters offer maximum storage, range, and efficiency. However, the difference between A and S class is relatively marginal, while finding an S-class requires significantly more grinding time.

## How to Get an S-Class Freighter

### The Save-Scum Method (Most Efficient)

#### Step 1: Trigger a Freighter Battle
- Play for **3 hours** of active gameplay
- Make **5 consecutive warp jumps**
- On the 5th jump, a freighter battle will trigger (pirates attacking a freighter)

#### Step 2: Before Your 5th Jump
**Make a manual save** at a space station or using your ship (exit and re-enter)

#### Step 3: Target Wealthy Systems
- Use your **Economy Scanner** to find 3-star economy systems
- Wealthy systems have higher S-class spawn rates

#### Step 4: The Reload Loop
1. Warp to a wealthy system (your 5th jump)
2. Battle triggers - defeat the pirates
3. Land on the freighter and **Inspect** it (don't accept yet!)
4. Check if it's S-class and the design you want
5. **If not S-class**: Reload your save and warp to a **different** wealthy system
6. Repeat until you get S-class

#### Step 5: Accept or Buy
- Your **first freighter rescue is FREE** (even S-class!)
- If you already own a freighter, S-class capitals cost ~126-178M units

### S-Class Spawn Rates

**Standard Systems:**
- Poor economy (1-star): 0% S-class
- Medium economy (2-star): 1% S-class
- Wealthy economy (3-star): 2% S-class

**Outlaw/Pirate Systems:**
- 5% S-class spawn rate (best odds!)

### Key Tips
- The battle is **scripted** - reloading guarantees another battle on your next jump
- Capital freighters (Venator/Sentinel) only spawn in battles
- You can check the class before accepting
- Be patient - 2% spawn rate means lots of reloads

### Fastest Route if You Have Units
If you already have a freighter and want to upgrade, keep reloading and trying different wealthy systems until you find an S-class to purchase.

## Economy Scanner

### How to Get It

#### Easiest Method: Buy from the Anomaly
1. **Visit the Space Anomaly** (call it from Quick Menu)
2. Go to the back area with the **Starship upgrade vendors**
3. Find the **Starship Technology merchant**
4. Purchase the **Economy Scanner blueprint** for **150 Nanites**

#### Crafting Requirements
- **5 Microprocessors**
- **1 Wiring Loom**

Then install it in your starship's technology slots.

#### Alternative Method
Sometimes found at **crashed ships** via distress beacons (less reliable).

### What It Does
Once installed, the Economy Scanner lets you:
- See a system's **economy type and wealth level** in the Galactic Map (shows star ratings)
- Locate **Trading Posts** while flying in a system

**Essential for finding 3-star (wealthy) systems where S-class freighters have higher spawn rates!**

## Should You Wait for S-Class?

### Recommendation: Take an A-Class (or Even B-Class) and Move On

#### Why NOT to Wait for S-Class on Your First Freighter

**1. Minimal Difference**
- The jump between A and S class is small
- Mainly affects hyperdrive range, which you can compensate for with other methods

**2. Time Investment is HUGE**
- Expect **2-3+ hours** of save-scumming reloads for S-class in wealthy systems (1-2% spawn rate)
- Some players report spending 6+ hours
- Even in Outlaw systems (5% rate), expect significant reload time

**3. First Freighters are Small Anyway**
- Your first battle encounter usually gives you a smaller capital freighter
- You'll likely want to upgrade later regardless

**4. Opportunity Cost**
You're missing out on:
- Freighter storage (48 general + 21 tech slots even on lower classes)
- **Frigate missions** that earn tons of units and resources
- Base building on your freighter
- Mobile base of operations

**5. You Can Upgrade Later**
- Once you're earning units from frigate missions, saving 150-170M for an S-class capital becomes much easier

### The Smart Strategy

1. **Save before your 5th warp**
2. **Aim for a Capital freighter** you like the look of (Venator or Sentinel)
3. **Take the first A-class** (or even B-class if you like the design)
4. **Start frigate missions immediately** to earn units
5. **Save up and buy your dream S-class capital** later when you have the funds

### Exception: Outlaw Systems
If you want to try for S-class, **Outlaw/Pirate systems** have **5% spawn rate** (vs 2% in wealthy systems), making it more realistic. But still expect significant reload time.

**Bottom line**: Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Get a freighter now, start making money, upgrade later!

## Buying vs Battle Encounters

### Option 1: Battle Encounters (The Save-Scum Method)

**Pros:**
- Wait for the scripted battle (3 hours + 5 warps)
- Reload saves to hunt for S-class
- First one is **free** if you don't own a freighter yet
- Only way to guarantee **Capital Freighters** (Venator/Sentinel - the big ones)

**Cons:**
- Requires time investment and patience
- Must wait for cooldown (3 hours + 5 warps)

### Option 2: Buy from Regular Fleets (Anytime)

You can buy freighters **without battles** by:

1. **Fly around in space** and look for freighter fleets
2. Look for the **white freighter icon** on your HUD - this indicates it's purchasable
3. **Land in the hangar bay** of any freighter with the icon
4. **Go to the bridge** (two floors up) and talk to the captain
5. **Make an offer** to purchase it

**Limitations:**
- **Regular fleets** mostly have **System Freighters** (smaller, regular designs)
- You **rarely** see Capital Freighters (Venator/Sentinel) in regular fleets
- The class is **random** - you'd still need to check multiple freighters to find S-class
- Costs range from **5M to 178M units** depending on size and class

### Bottom Line

**If you want a Capital Freighter** (the massive Star Destroyer-style ones), you **must** use the battle encounter method.

**If you're okay with a System Freighter**, you can buy from regular fleets anytime, but finding S-class is still random.

Even with money, you still need to hunt for the right freighter - either through battles or by checking regular fleets!
