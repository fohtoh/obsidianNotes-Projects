# Honey Farming Guide - No Man's Sky

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT UPDATE (2025)
**The desert/barren planet secondary resource method was REMOVED in the Waypoint update (2022) and NO LONGER WORKS.**

Plants on barren planets no longer drop Sticky 'Honey' as a secondary resource when mined. The game now only gives generic resources (Oxygen, Condensed Carbon, Di-hydrogen, Sodium, Chromatic Metal) from plant mining.

## Overview
This guide covers the **CURRENT working methods** to obtain Sticky 'Honey' and Synthetic Honey in No Man's Sky as of 2025.

---

## Method 1: Feed Lok (Blob Creatures) ✅ PRIMARY METHOD

### What are Lok Creatures?
Lok are bouncing/hopping blob creatures that make **croaking sounds**. They have **no recognizable legs** (except crustacean variants) and come in 8 variants:

- **Colony** - Multi-headed bouncing blob
- **Plant** - Looks like a sentient pineapple
- **Squid** - Head with neck on legless torso
- **Blobby** - Clear facial structure
- **Worm-like** - Multiple eyes with vertical mouth
- **Large Blob** - Semi-spherical, minimal appendages
- **Large Blob Tendrilled** - Semi-spherical with visible appendages
- **Lesser Meadow Crab** - Crustacean-like with leg appendages

### Where to Find Lok:
- **Underground caves** (most common location)
- **Toxic/Radioactive planets** (higher reported spawn rates)
- **RARITY:** Rare spawns, but planets may have multiple species
- Each species is either above ground OR in caves (not both)

### How to Get Honey from Lok:

1. **Craft Creature Pellets:**
   - Open inventory → Select empty slot
   - Craft using: **60 Carbon** per pellet
   - All creatures eat Creature Pellets (universal bait)

2. **Feed the Lok:**
   - Approach blob creature
   - Use Quick Menu or place pellets directly
   - Feed them the pellets

3. **Collect Honey:**
   - Lok produce **Sticky 'Honey'** as an animal byproduct when fed
   - Collect it immediately after feeding

**Best for:** Renewable, reliable long-term source

---

## Method 2: Find Slug Creatures
- Listen for a distinctive deep **"WHAAHH" sound** near open cave entrances
- Slug creatures can also drop honey when fed Creature Pellets
- Look for planets with higher creature counts to increase chances

**Best for:** Alternative to Lok if you find them first

---

## Method 3: Synthetic Honey (Backup Option)
- Craft it in the **Nutrient Processor**
- Can also obtain from the **"Sweet Tooth" mission**

**Best for:** When you can't find natural sources or need honey immediately

---

## ❌ OUTDATED METHODS (DO NOT USE)

### Desert/Barren Planet "Secondary Resource" Method - REMOVED
**STATUS:** Removed in Waypoint update (2022), does NOT work in current version

- ~~Search for cone-shaped dripping plants on desert/barren planets~~
- ~~Mine plants for honey as secondary resource~~
- **WHY IT DOESN'T WORK:** Biome-specific secondary resources were intentionally removed to "avoid polluting inventories." Plants now only drop generic resources.

### Plant Shooting Exploit - PATCHED
**STATUS:** Bug was fixed in a patch

- ~~Shoot honey plants to fill entire inventory with 30,000 honey~~
- **WHY IT DOESN'T WORK:** This was a bug and has been patched out.

## Can You Farm Honey at Your Base?

**NO** - Sticky honey plants are NOT farmable crops in No Man's Sky.

While you can build:
- **Hydroponic Trays** (Pure Ferrite ×30 + Metal Plating ×2 + Carbon ×20)
- **Bio-Domes** (holds 16 plants, requires 50kP power)

...honey-producing plants are NOT available as seeds to grow in your base.

### Alternative: Build a "Lok Farm" Base

1. Find a planet with high Lok creature density
2. Build a base there
3. Set up Carbon farming for mass Creature Pellet production
4. Regularly feed Lok and harvest honey

---

## Recommended Strategy (2025)

### For Regular Honey Collection:
1. **Explore caves on toxic/radioactive planets** to find Lok creatures
2. **Stock up on Carbon** (60 per Creature Pellet)
3. **Feed Lok systematically** and collect honey
4. **Optional:** Build base on Lok-rich planet for farming

### For Quick Honey:
1. Craft **Synthetic Honey** in Nutrient Processor (if you have the recipe)
2. Complete **"Sweet Tooth" mission**

---

## Tips & Notes

- **Creature Pellet Blueprint:** Available at the Anomaly or from missions
- **Finding Lok:** Check your Analysis Visor for fauna - Lok will show as "Blob" genus
- **Higher creature count planets** increase chances of finding Lok/slug creatures
- **Cave exploration** is currently the most reliable way to find Lok
- **Carbon sources:** Trees, plants, or Oxygen + Condensed Carbon in refiner
- **Barren "Hives" subtype planets** may have honey-producing minerals (unconfirmed if extractable)
