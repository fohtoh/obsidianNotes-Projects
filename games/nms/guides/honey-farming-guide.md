# Honey Farming Guide - No Man's Sky

## Overview
This guide covers the best methods to obtain Sticky 'Honey' and Synthetic Honey in No Man's Sky.

## Method 1: Feed Blob Creatures (Most Reliable)
- Look for **blob-type creatures (Lok)** - they bounce, hop, twirl, and often have many eyes
- Feed them **Creature Pellets**
- They'll produce Sticky 'Honey' when fed
- **Best for:** Renewable, reliable source

## Method 2: Harvest Desert/Barren Planet Plants (Best for Bulk Farming)
- Search for **desert or barren planets**, especially in **Green Star systems**
- Look for distinctive **cone-shaped dripping plants** that you can spot from your ship
- These plants yield Sticky 'Honey' as a harvestable resource
- Also found on: Toxic, Gamma, Radioactive, and Anonymous biome planets
- **Best for:** Quick bulk collection

## Method 3: Find Slug Creatures
- Listen for a distinctive deep **"WHAAHH" sound** near open cave entrances
- Slug creatures can also drop honey when fed
- Look for planets with higher creature counts to increase your chances

## Alternative: Synthetic Honey
- Craft it in the **Nutrient Processor**
- Can also obtain from the **"Sweet Tooth" mission**
- **Best for:** When you can't find natural sources

## Recommended Strategy
- **Quick honey needed:** Use the desert planet plant method once you find a good location
- **Long-term renewable source:** Set up near blob creatures and feed them pellets regularly
- **Emergency:** Craft Synthetic Honey in the Nutrient Processor

## Tips
- Planets with higher creature counts increase your opportunity to find blob or slug creatures
- Green Star systems almost guarantee honey-producing plants on desert planets
- The cone-shaped dripping plants are visible from your ship, making scanning easier
