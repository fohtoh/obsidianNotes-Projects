# Common Chord Progressions in Popular Music

## Introduction

Chord progressions are the backbone of most songs. They're described using Roman numerals or scale degrees (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) that represent chords built on each note of the scale. This system allows the same progression to work in any key.

**Key:**
- Uppercase Roman numerals (I, IV, V) = Major chords
- Lowercase Roman numerals (ii, iii, vi) = Minor chords
- Numbers (1, 4, 5, 6) can represent the scale degree or chord root

## Tips for Understanding Progressions

### Roman Numeral System
- **I, IV, V** = Major chords (strong, bright)
- **ii, iii, vi** = Minor chords (softer, darker)
- **vii°** = Diminished chord (tense, needs resolution)

### Functional Harmony
- **I (Tonic)** = Home base, resolution
- **IV (Subdominant)** = Movement away from home
- **V (Dominant)** = Tension that wants to resolve to I
- **vi (Relative minor)** = Emotional alternative to I

### Common Substitutions
- **vi can substitute for I** (both are tonic function)
- **ii can substitute for IV** (both are subdominant function)
- **iii can substitute for V or I** (weaker but adds color)
